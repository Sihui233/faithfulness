    "source": "DOBBS: General Motors today announced it will offer early retirement buyouts for 113,000 of its employees. Management calls it, quote, \"accelerated attrition,\" end quote. And it is only the latest sign of the dramatic decline of the American automobile industry and the continued assault on working men and women in this country. General Motors reporting a $10.6 billion loss in 2005. The company continues to lose market share. Hourly employees will be eligible for lump sum payments of up to as much as $140,000 depending on years of service. Bankrupt auto parts supplier Delphi also offer a buyout to 13,000 employees who can receive up to $35,000. General Motors hoping that these buyouts will help it meet its goal of cutting 30,000 jobs by 2008. Ford also planning to eliminate 30,000 jobs, Daimler Chrysler has a goal of 40,000 jobs. General Motors negotiated the terms of the buyout with the United Auto Workers Union. Employees will have up to 52 days to accept or reject the offers. Consumers personal information is a billion-dollar business for data brokers and marketers in this country. Now the Internal Revenue Service believes the information in your tax return should be for sale, to them. And for the first time, it wants to allow accountants and tax preparation companies such as H&R; Block to sell your personal information. Lisa Sylvester reports.\nLISA SYLVESTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Your tax returns are in many ways a map of your entire life. How much you make, your medical cost, charitable donations. It's all there. An Internal Revenue Service proposal would allow tax preparers to sell that information to marketing companies and data brokers.\nBETH GIVENS, PRIVACY RIGHTS CLEARINGHOUSE: I think this is a shockingly bad idea, to allow tax preparers to sell these very sensitive documents. The information contained tells a lot about us, about our families.\nSYLVESTER: The IRS ironically claims that its doing this to improve consumer protections. The agency argues that it would require consent before tax returns could be sent overseas for processing or disclosed to third parties. In a statement, the IRS commissioner said, \"The heart of this proposed regulation is about the right of taxpayers to control their tax return information.\" But many consumers could unwittingly sign away their privacy.\nPETER SWIRE, CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS: The permission here is fake permission. The accountant sets all the little tabs out there and little red tabs and says sign here in all these places. And then you sign the consent and your record is now being sold to a database company.\nSYLVESTER: It's hard to see why consumers would want to have their information sold.\nBETH MCCONNELL, PENN. PIRG: I think it's incredibly significant, not only given the epidemic of identity theft that affects more than 9 million Americans every single year, but also just the barrage of marketing and advertising that consumers are already having a hard time controlling.\nSYLVESTER: Consumer groups say for individuals, there's nothing to gain by having their records sold and everything to lose.\nSYLVESTER: H&R; Block did not return our calls for comment on this story. And there's a real sense that the IRS was trying to fly this one in under the radar. It called the change not a significant regulatory action, although most taxpayers would probably beg to differ, Lou.\nDOBBS: Well, it is under the heading of, you can't make this stuff up. The Internal Revenue Service saying that we would be sharing our personal tax information to protect the privacy of our tax information. It's Orwellian. It's breathtaking and we thank you, Lisa Sylvester. A reminder now to vote in our poll. Do you believe as members of the Bush administration claim, that the media is to blame for the rising public opposition to the war in Iraq? Cast your vote at LouDobbs.com, please. We'll have the results for you coming up here shortly. Also ahead, another look at your thoughts and then God and politics. The Catholic Church and its controversial stance on illegal immigration and federal legislation. I'll be joined by one of the church's influential priest, who says illegal immigrants are needed here to fill those jobs that Americans just won't do. You're heard that language before.

    "source": "ROBERTS: Welcome back to the Most News in the Morning. You've seen their faces. The two American journalists captured and accused of spying in North Korea. And within hours, they are set to go on trial. The sister of one of the journalists, reporter Lisa Ling from CNN's \"PLANET IN PERIL\" series has pleaded for their release. Our Jason Carroll here now with what a trial in North Korea could mean. And by any stretch of the imagination, it's got to be a frightening prospect.\nJASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. And this has been so -- this has been such a terrifying ordeal, not only for the two women who are involved but for the families as well. If the trial proceeds and there is a conviction, they could be looking at an independent sentence at a prison or a labor camp. One of the many problems here is so little is known about North Korea, let alone the country's legal system. What is known, a fair trial is not likely.\nCARROLL (voice-over): Trapped in one of the most isolated countries in the world, North Korea, imprisoned, accused of spying and awaiting trial. This is what American journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee are facing. Their families pleading for their release saying both women are terrified.\nLISA LING, SISTER OF KIDNAPPED JOURNALIST: They never meant to cross into North Korea. I mean, that was never their objective. And if for some reason they may have, then we are sorry. And we hope that the North Korean government will show mercy.\nCARROLL: Lisa Ling received a surprise call from her sister last Tuesday saying she was being treated fairly. Ling who is also a journalist has reported from North Korea for \"National Geographic\" and knows just how dangerous the country can be.\nLING: How does the great leader defend it against big powers like America.\nCARROLL: With his wife's trial just one day away, Laura Ling's husband said the strain has been unbearable.\nIAIN CLAYTON, HUSBAND OF KIDNAPPED JOURNALIST: As you can imagine, it's probably been, you know, the worst few months of my life.\nCARROLL: Both Ling and Lee are reporters for \"Current TV,\" a media venture started by former Vice President Al Gore. They were reporting on North Korean defectors living along the China-North Korea border when they were taken into custody on March 17. The North Korean government claiming the two entered the country, illegally, a charge the State Department and Lisa Ling deny. In an interview on AMERICAN MORNING, former vice president says he'd even consider going to North Korea to help.\nAL GORE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT: I would do anything within reason including that at the drop of the hat. But it is -- that's not -- it's not some place that you just buy a ticket and show up at the airport.\nCARROLL: Complicating diplomacy, North Korea angered the world with recent nuclear test and missile launches. Ambassador Wendy Sherman is an expert on the region and has met the country's leader, Kim Jong-Il, and knows he will influence the trial's outcome.\nWENDY SHERMAN, FORMER NORTH KOREA POLICY COORDINATOR: He understands how important family is to each other. And so I hope that he takes that understanding and releases these two young women and returns them to their families.\nCARROLL: Victor Cha has also been to North Korea, the former director for Asian Affairs under George W. Bush says the country's legal system has little rhyme or reason.\nVICTOR CHA, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY, CSIS KOREA CHAIR: I think what you would expect to see is something in between a prison sentence to, you know, perhaps even sentencing to some sort of labor camp. Hopefully, those will just be a token sort of punishment.\nCARROLL: Again, the trial is set for Thursday. Representatives from Sweden have been working behind the scenes to try to engage the North Koreans. They're looking at what happened in the '90s when an American pilot accidentally flew over the region and was taken into custody. He was released after he promised to apologize.\nROBERTS: She had this ghost coming down hours from now. Jason, thanks so much. Don't miss \"AC360\" tonight, by the way. Lisa Ling and both journalists' husbands will be live with Anderson at a vigil, hoping for their release. That's on \"AC360\" tonight at 10:00 Eastern.",

        "\"ROBERTS: Welcome back to the Most News in the Morning. You've seen their faces. The two American journalists captured and accused of spying in North Korea. And within hours, they are set to go on trial. The sister of one of the journalists, reporter Lisa Ling from CNN's \\\"PLANET IN PERIL\\\" series has pleaded for their release. Our Jason Carroll here now with what a trial in North Korea could mean. And by any stretch of the imagination, it's got to be a frightening prospect.\\nJASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. And this has been so -- this has been such a terrifying ordeal, not only for the two women who are involved but for the families as well. If the trial proceeds and there is a conviction, they could be looking at an independent sentence at a prison or a labor camp. One of the many problems here is so little is known about North Korea, let alone the country's legal system. What is known, a fair trial is not likely.\\nCARROLL (voice-over): Trapped in one of the most isolated countries in the world, North Korea, imprisoned, accused of spying and awaiting trial. This is what American journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee are facing. Their families pleading for their release saying both women are terrified.\\nLISA LING, SISTER OF KIDNAPPED JOURNALIST: They never meant to cross into North Korea. I mean, that was never their objective. And if for some reason they may have, then we are sorry. And we hope that the North Korean government will show mercy.\\nCARROLL: Lisa Ling received a surprise call from her sister last Tuesday saying she was being treated fairly. Ling who is also a journalist has reported from North Korea for \\\"National Geographic\\\" and knows just how dangerous the country can be.\\nLING: How does the great leader defend it against big powers like America.\\nCARROLL: With his wife's trial just one day away, Laura Ling's husband said the strain has been unbearable.\\nIAIN CLAYTON, HUSBAND OF KIDNAPPED JOURNALIST: As you can imagine, it's probably been, you know, the worst few months of my life.\\nCARROLL: Both Ling and Lee are reporters for \\\"Current TV,\\\" a media venture started by former Vice President Al Gore. They were reporting on North Korean defectors living along the China-North Korea border when they were taken into custody on March 17. The North Korean government claiming the two entered the country, illegally, a charge the State Department and Lisa Ling deny. In an interview on AMERICAN MORNING, former vice president says he'd even consider going to North Korea to help.\\nAL GORE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT: I would do anything within reason including that at the drop of the hat. But it is -- that's not -- it's not some place that you just buy a ticket and show up at the airport.\\nCARROLL: Complicating diplomacy, North Korea angered the world with recent nuclear test and missile launches. Ambassador Wendy Sherman is an expert on the region and has met the country's leader, Kim Jong-Il, and knows he will influence the trial's outcome.\\nWENDY SHERMAN, FORMER NORTH KOREA POLICY COORDINATOR: He understands how important family is to each other. And so I hope that he takes that understanding and releases these two young women and returns them to their families.\\nCARROLL: Victor Cha has also been to North Korea, the former director for Asian Affairs under George W. Bush says the country's legal system has little rhyme or reason.\\nVICTOR CHA, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY, CSIS KOREA CHAIR: I think what you would expect to see is something in between a prison sentence to, you know, perhaps even sentencing to some sort of labor camp. Hopefully, those will just be a token sort of punishment.\\nCARROLL: Again, the trial is set for Thursday. Representatives from Sweden have been working behind the scenes to try to engage the North Koreans. They're looking at what happened in the '90s when an American pilot accidentally flew over the region and was taken into custody. He was released after he promised to apologize.\\nROBERTS: She had this ghost coming down hours from now. Jason, thanks so much. Don't miss \\\"AC360\\\" tonight, by the way. Lisa Ling and both journalists' husbands will be live with Anderson at a vigil, hoping for their release. That's on \\\"AC360\\\" tonight at 10:00 Eastern.\""

    "source": "ANNOUNCER: This is CNN breaking news.\nMALVEAUX: We want to go directly to Al Franken. He is Minnesota's new senator -- that declared today, after a very long and contentious race. Let's take a quick listen to Al Franken at the mike.\nAL FRANKEN, WINNER OF MINNESOTA SENATE RACE: I'm thrilled and honored by the faith that Minnesotans have placed in me. I'm also humbled, not just by the closeness of this election, but by the enormity of the responsibility that comes with this office. We have a lot of work to do in Washington, but that's why I signed up for the job in the first place. When we started this campaign way back in February of 2007, I said that Americans have never backed away from tough challenges and Minnesotans have always led the way. Working with our fantastic senior senator, Amy Klobuchar, I'm going to fight hard to make quality health care accessible and affordable to all Minnesotans, to make sure that our kids have an education that prepares them for a 21st century economy, to make Minnesota the epicenter of a new, renewable energy economy that frees us from our dependence on foreign oil, to restore our standing in the world and put people to work here at home. To those Minnesotans who worked for me, volunteered for me, voted for me, I can't tell you how grateful I am. When you win an election this close, you know that not one bit of effort went to waste. And to those who devoted their time and energy to supporting Senator Coleman, I can only imagine how hard these past months have been. But no matter whether you voted for me or for Senator Coleman or for Senator Barkley or whether you voted at all, I want the people of Minnesota to know that I'm ready to work for all of you, that I'm committed to being a voice for all Minnesotans in the U.S. Senate. I know there's been a lot of talk about the fact that when I'm sworn in, I'll be the 60th member of the Democratic Caucus. But that's -- that's not how I see it. The way I see it, I'm not going to Washington to be the 60th Democratic senator, I'm going to Washington to be the second senator from the State of Minnesota. And that's how I'm going to do this job.\nMALVEAUX: Minnesota's new senator, Al Franken, saying he is ready to go to work for his state. I want to bring in own Gloria Borger to kind of give us a lay of the land here. Obviously, it's a race that everybody has been following for quite some time. This is the next step now. What -- what does this mean for -- for the Democrats now that they have a larger majority?\nGLORIA BORGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, it means that they've got 60 seats, which would give them a filibuster-proof majority. But that's assuming that Democrats, and two Independents who we include in that, would agree on everything which is, of course, a large assumption that is not necessarily true.\nMALVEAUX: Sure.\nBORGER: But, of course, they'll take every vote they can get at this point. Don't forget, this has been a hotly contested fight over these last eight months -- very divisive, splitting the parties in the Senate, leaving the State of Minnesota unrepresented. And so I think that a lot of people on both sides of the aisle are kind of breathing a sigh of relief that it's -- that it's finally over, no matter how it was decided.\nMALVEAUX: Do you think it helps the Obama administration and the president pushing forward some of the things that have been so difficult for him, whether it's energy or health care?\nBORGER: Sure.\nMALVEAUX: Obviously...\nBORGER: Yes. Sure. I think it does. I mean, look, a vote is a vote is a vote. And I think Al Franken's politics are clearly more on the liberal side. So he would be more likely to go along with Barack Obama on things like climate change, on things like health care reform, than somebody like Democrat Ben Nelson of Nebraska, who's much more of a moderate who he may lose on certain votes.\nMALVEAUX: Sure.\nBORGER: So I think that they would look at Franken as much more dependable.\nMALVEAUX: OK. Gloria Borger making sense of all of this. Thank you so much.\nBORGER: Sure.\nMALVEAUX: One of Michael Jackson's prized acquisitions was the rights to a vast Beatles music library. Well, what is -- what will happen to that practically priceless catalog now? Iranian leaders say the election is confirmed and they will tolerate no more protests. But what happens to those arrested during the uprising? Will their families ever see them again?",

Let's take a quick listen to Al Franken at the mike.\nAL FRANKEN, WINNER OF MINNESOTA SENATE RACE: I'm thrilled and honored by the faith that Minnesotans have placed in me. I'm also humbled, not just by the closeness of this election, but by the enormity of the responsibility that comes with this office. We have a lot of work to do in Washington, but that's why I signed up for the job in the first place. When we started this campaign way back in February of 2007, I said that Americans have never backed away from tough challenges and Minnesotans have always led the way. Working with our fantastic senior senator, Amy Klobuchar, I'm going to fight hard to make quality health care accessible and affordable to all Minnesotans, to make sure that our kids have an education that prepares them for a 21st century economy, to make Minnesota the epicenter of a new, renewable energy economy that frees us from our dependence on foreign oil, to restore our standing in the world and put people to work here at home. To those Minnesotans who worked for me, volunteered for me, voted for me, I can't tell you how grateful I am. When you win an election this close, you know that not one bit of effort went to waste. And to those who devoted their time and energy to supporting Senator Coleman, I can only imagine how hard these past months have been. But no matter whether you voted for me or for Senator Coleman or for Senator Barkley or whether you voted at all, I want the people of Minnesota to know that I'm ready to work for all of you, that I'm committed to being a voice for all Minnesotans in the U.S. Senate. I know there's been a lot of talk about the fact that when I'm sworn in, I'll be the 60th member of the Democratic Caucus. But that's -- that's not how I see it. The way I see it, I'm not going to Washington to be the 60th Democratic senator, I'm going to Washington to be the second senator from the State of Minnesota. And that's how I'm going to do this job.\nMALVEAUX: Minnesota's new senator, Al Franken, saying he is ready to go to work for his state. I want to bring in own Gloria Borger to kind of give us a lay of the land here. Obviously, it's a race that everybody has been following for quite some time. This is the next step now. What -- what does this mean for -- for the Democrats now that they have a larger majority?\nGLORIA BORGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, it means that they've got 60 seats, which would give them a filibuster-proof majority. But that's assuming that Democrats, and two Independents who we include in that, would agree on everything which is, of course, a large assumption that is not necessarily true.\nMALVEAUX: Sure.\nBORGER: But, of course, they'll take every vote they can get at this point. Don't forget, this has been a hotly contested fight over these last eight months -- very divisive, splitting the parties in the Senate, leaving the State of Minnesota unrepresented. And so I think that a lot of people on both sides of the aisle are kind of breathing a sigh of relief that it's -- that it's finally over, no matter how it was decided.\nMALVEAUX: Do you think it helps the Obama administration and the president pushing forward some of the things that have been so difficult for him, whether it's energy or health care?\nBORGER: Sure.\nMALVEAUX: Obviously...\nBORGER: Yes.

They are both doing outstanding work each and every day. I want to acknowledge Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson, who is from Texas. And she is one of the members of our Science and Technology Committee and doing outstanding work. NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden is in the house. Where's Charlie?\nOBAMA: And that leadership tomorrow depends on how we educate our students today, especially in those fields that hold the promise of producing future innovations and innovators. And that's why education in math and science is so important. Now, the hard truth is that for decades we've been losing ground. One assessment shows American 15-year-olds now rank 21st in science and 25th in math when compared to their peers around their world. And this isn't news. We've seen warring statistics like this for years. Yet, time and again, we've let partisan and petty bickering stand in the way of progress. And time and again as a nation, we've let our children down. So I'm here and you are here because we all believe that we can't allow division and indifference to imperil our position in the world. It's time for all of us in Washington and across America to take responsibility for our future. And that's why I'm committed to moving our country from the middle to the top of the pack in science and math education over the next decade. To meet the goal, the Recovery Act included the largest investment in education in history, while preventing hundreds of thousands of educators from being fired because of state budget shortfalls. Under the outstanding leadership of Arne Duncan, we've launched a $4 billion Race to the Top fund, one of the largest investments in education reform in history. And through the Race to the Top, states won't just be receiving funding; they'll have to compete for funding. And in this competition, producing the most innovative programs in math and science will be an advantage. In addition, we are challenging states to improve achievement by raising standards, using data to better inform decisions and take new approaches to turn around struggling schools. And because a great teacher is the single most important factor in a great education, we're asking states to focus on teacher effectiveness and to make it possible for professionals, like many of the people in this room, to bring their experience and enthusiasm into the classroom. But you are here because you know that the success we seek is not going to be attained by government alone. It depends on the dedication of students and parents and the commitment of private citizens, organizations and companies. It depends on all of us. And that's why, back in April, at the National Academy of Sciences, I issued a challenge: to encourage folks to think of new and creative ways of engaging young people in science and engineering. And we are here because the leaders in this room answered that call to action. Today we are launching the Educate to Innovate Campaign, a nationwide effort to help reach the goal this administration has set: moving to the top in science and math education in the next decade. We've got leaders from private companies and universities, foundations and nonprofits and organizations representing millions of scientists, engineers and teachers from across America.\nOBAMA: The initial commitment of the private sector to this campaign is more than $260 million, and we only expect the campaign to grow. Business leaders from Intel, Xerox, Kodak and Time Warner Cable are teaming up with Sally Ride and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as the Carnegie Corporation, to find and replicate successful science, math and technology programs all across America. \"Sesame Street\" has become a two-year initiative to teach young kids about math and science, and Discovery Communications is going to deliver interactive science content to 60,000 schools, reaching 35 million students. These efforts extend beyond the classroom. Time Warner Cable is joining with the Coalition for Science After School and FIRST Robotics, the program created by inventor Dean Kamen, which gave us the Cougar Cannon to connect 1 million students with fun after-school activities like robotics competitions. The MacArthur Foundation and industry leaders like Sony are launching a nationwide challenge to design compelling, freely available science-related video games. And organizations representing teachers, scientists, mathematicians and engineers, joined by volunteers in the community, are participating in a grassroots effort called National Lab Day to reach 10 million young people with hands-on learning. Students will launch rockets, construct miniature windmills and get their hands dirty. They'll have the chance to build and create, and maybe destroy just a little bit...\nOBAMA: Now, I have to say to the young people who are here, we can't let students off the hook. In the end, the success of this campaign depends on them. But I believe strongly that America's young people will rise to the challenge if given the opportunity, and given a little bit of a push. We've got to work together to create these opportunities because our future depends on them. And I just want to mention the importance not only for students but also of parents. You know, I was in Asia, I think, many of you are aware, for a week. And I was having lunch with the president of South Korea, President Lee. And I was interested in the education policy -- they've grown enormously over the last 40 years -- and I asked them what are the biggest challenges in your education policy. He said, you know, \"The biggest challenge that I have is that my parents are too demanding.\"",

    "source": "FEYERICK: We'll get to Donald Trump's campaign stump in just a second, but first a look at his marital status. How many wives? There were three. Ivanna, they had three children together. Then, of course, there was Marla Maples, the other woman. They had a daughter. And the last, he's currently married to Milania Trump. They have a son together. Now to the mogul's political aspirations - Trump is scheduled to speak at this Tea Party rally in Boca Raton, Florida. He'll bring his comments to you. Trump is considering running for president. He's expected to make a final decision by June. Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak may be on the move. An army spokesman tells CNN Mubarak was transferred from a hospital in Sharm el Sheikh to a military facility in Cairo. Several riot police standing guard outside the hospital say Mubarak is still there. The former president is under investigation for the deaths of protesters during the recent uprising. Government forces are pounding Libya's third largest city with rockets. Rebels say Gadhafi troops shelled a neighborhood, killing three people. It comes one day after a human rights group claims government forces fired cluster bombs into civilian areas. And at least five NATO service members and four Afghan soldiers were killed in a suicide bombing in Afghanistan. The bomber was wearing an Afghan national army uniform. In Cuba this weekend, it's national celebration and an important gathering of the communist government. CNN's Shasta Darlington was in Havana today, and you had watched this huge military parade 50 years after the invasion of the Bay of Pigs, really interesting historically.\nSHASTA DARLINGTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely, Deb. This was a massive celebration of Cuba's past victories. We saw tanks rumbling through revolution plaza, tighter jets flying overhead. Thousands of troops and civilians, people from the neighborhoods coming out and marching in support of their revolution and in celebration of these major victories. It was 50 years ago this small Caribbean island defeated a U.S.-backed invasion of the Bay of Pigs. It was led by Cuban exiles, but it was really considered a defeat for Washington. They failed to provide air support. And of course Cubans never rose up and joined in the fight. A major victory, of course, for Cuba. This afternoon we'll see, as you mentioned, he was going to start looking for the future. The leaders will meet behind closed doors for a four-day meeting of the communist party. In fact, it's the first Congress of the communist party in nearly 14 years. They're going to focus on the economy and needed reforms there. President Raul Castro has called for more private enterprise and less of a role from the state. They want to do major layoffs in the state sector and allow more people to get into business for themselves in things like plumbing, gardening, opening up restaurants. They'll also talk property ownership, which could mean Cubans for the first time in decades could buy and sell homes and possibly even all those old cars could be affected if they allow Cubans to buy and sell more modern vehicles, Deb.\nFEYERICK: Shasta, I read something like 170,000 Cubans have actually taken out licenses to open their own business. Very quickly, why 14 years? Are communists coming from elsewhere? Is this an internal meeting of the leaders there in Cuba?\nDARLINGTON: Deb, it's a good question. They should be holding these meetings every five years. We haven't had one since 1997. Part of the disruption was, of course, when Fidel Castro fell ill, there was the transition from one government to another. Then massive hurricanes sort of hit the economy, global crisis, lots of different reasons. But they couldn't wait any longer. This is probably the first Congress solely dedicated to economic reform and the time is right. They knew they had to do something, and president Raul Castro has already called for many of these reforms. They're hoping to get even more done once they ever got the leaders together.\nFEYERICK: We will be keeping an eye on it, Shasta Darlington in Cuba. Thank you so much. R&B; singer usher gives his all on stage. When he's not performing, he's giving back to the community through his new look foundation. He explains how in this \"Impact your World.\"\nUSHER, SINGER: This is Usher. We can make an impact on our young people. My new look foundation was founded in 1999. I started it because I wanted to do something that I thought would impact youth. We mostly focus on mentoring youth, showing them a new look on life through new world experiences. There's a focus on leadership as well as service. My hopes are I'm introducing tomorrow's service-minded youth leader. Our children are our future. This is our opportunity to make it better by motivating them now. Join the movement, CNN.com/impact.\nFEYERICK: CNN's \"Impact your World\" is challenging you to pledge at least 11 volunteer hours in 2011. Go on CNN.com/impact or text impact, space, and the number 11 to 22360. Make your pledge today. Volunteer. When you complete your hours, go back to the webpage to submit your photos or video.

    "source": "FEYERICK: We'll get to Donald Trump's campaign stump in just a second, but first a look at his marital status. How many wives? There were three. Ivanna, they had three children together. Then, of course, there was Marla Maples, the other woman. They had a daughter. And the last, he's currently married to Milania Trump. They have a son together. Now to the mogul's political aspirations - Trump is scheduled to speak at this Tea Party rally in Boca Raton, Florida. He'll bring his comments to you. Trump is considering running for president. He's expected to make a final decision by June. Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak may be on the move. An army spokesman tells CNN Mubarak was transferred from a hospital in Sharm el Sheikh to a military facility in Cairo. Several riot police standing guard outside the hospital say Mubarak is still there. The former president is under investigation for the deaths of protesters during the recent uprising. Government forces are pounding Libya's third largest city with rockets. Rebels say Gadhafi troops shelled a neighborhood, killing three people. It comes one day after a human rights group claims government forces fired cluster bombs into civilian areas. And at least five NATO service members and four Afghan soldiers were killed in a suicide bombing in Afghanistan. The bomber was wearing an Afghan national army uniform. In Cuba this weekend, it's national celebration and an important gathering of the communist government. CNN's Shasta Darlington was in Havana today, and you had watched this huge military parade 50 years after the invasion of the Bay of Pigs, really interesting historically.\nSHASTA DARLINGTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely, Deb. This was a massive celebration of Cuba's past victories. We saw tanks rumbling through revolution plaza, tighter jets flying overhead. Thousands of troops and civilians, people from the neighborhoods coming out and marching in support of their revolution and in celebration of these major victories. It was 50 years ago this small Caribbean island defeated a U.S.-backed invasion of the Bay of Pigs. It was led by Cuban exiles, but it was really considered a defeat for Washington. They failed to provide air support. And of course Cubans never rose up and joined in the fight. A major victory, of course, for Cuba. This afternoon we'll see, as you mentioned, he was going to start looking for the future. The leaders will meet behind closed doors for a four-day meeting of the communist party. In fact, it's the first Congress of the communist party in nearly 14 years. They're going to focus on the economy and needed reforms there. President Raul Castro has called for more private enterprise and less of a role from the state. They want to do major layoffs in the state sector and allow more people to get into business for themselves in things like plumbing, gardening, opening up restaurants. They'll also talk property ownership, which could mean Cubans for the first time in decades could buy and sell homes and possibly even all those old cars could be affected if they allow Cubans to buy and sell more modern vehicles, Deb.\nFEYERICK: Shasta, I read something like 170,000 Cubans have actually taken out licenses to open their own business. Very quickly, why 14 years? Are communists coming from elsewhere? Is this an internal meeting of the leaders there in Cuba?\nDARLINGTON: Deb, it's a good question. They should be holding these meetings every five years. We haven't had one since 1997.

    "topic": "Drugs found in Michael Jackson's system",
    "source": "LEMON: The trial of Dr. Conrad Murray gets underway on Monday. Murray's been charged with involuntary manslaughter in the death of Michael Jackson. Jackson died of an overdose of the anesthesia Propofol and other drugs. To find out what affects these drugs had, I spoke to a doctor who saw Jackson's autopsy report. His name is Dr. Zeev Cain. He is the head of the Anesthesiology Department at the University of California, Irvine.\nLEMON: You saw the toxicology report?\nDR. ZEEV CAIN, DIRECTOR, ANESTHESIOLOGY DEPARTMENT, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, IRVINE: I saw the toxicology repot. I saw the autopsy report.\nLEMON: You did?\nCAIN: I did.\nLEMON: What was in Michael Jackson's system?\nCAIN: Several drugs, Midazolam, Diazepam, Lorazepam, Lidocaine, Epinephrine and Propofol.\nLEMON: That's a lot.\nCAIN: That's a lot of drugs. That's a lot of drugs.\nLEMON: Enough to kill someone?\nCAIN: Certainly enough to make sure that he stopped breathing, yes.\nLEMON: Yes. What did the autopsy report show?\nCAIN: Well, overall, Michael Jackson was actually in good health. There was no real problems in his internal organs. It did show, at some point in the past, he did use drugs but, again, overall, he was in excellent health.\nLEMON: What kind of drugs?\nCAIN: You can't really say that. The only thing we can do is go based on what we found in his blood.\nLEMON: OK. It didn't show one drug which the defense is saying he was addicted to. What I'm talking about,\nCAIN: Absolutely true. There was no Demerol found there, which means he did not really take Demerol for 40 days before this.\nLEMON: How many days would it have been in order for it to leave?\nCAIN: Several days. Demerol actually has a pretty long half life. So it stays in the system quite a while.\nLEMON: Yes. Were you surprised by anything in the report?\nCAIN: I would say I was surprised by what in good shape he was. Based on what I've heard previously, I expected to see more signs of chronic illness in his organs, more signs of an addict. They are not really there. He was basically healthy.\nLEMON: Yes. Yes. And to have those drugs, you said Lorazepam --\nCAIN: Diazepam, Midazolam.\nLEMON: All those drugs in there together -- does someone usually take all of those drugs together?\nCAIN: You take them if you want to induce sedation or medically induced coma. Which brings me to the issue of Propofol should not be used in home settings.\nLEMON: Yes.\nCAIN: It should be used when you want to medially induce coma or sedation in a hospital. You have to monitor somebody's blood pressure, heart rate, how well they are breathing. You have to monitor their oxygen level. That's the bottom line.\nLEMON: So, listen, people are -- this is going to be the issue now with medicine. How much can you get from doctors, depending on how much you pay? Your celebrity status? What you do for a living? All of that, is that at issue here?\nCAIN: Absolutely, it is. Remember, they found four gallons. Four gallons are enough to put to sleep about 500 people. Or it is enough to keep somebody asleep for eight hours for almost two months. Now, that may be a bit misleading, because he may have built resistance in his body already. We have to remember, when somebody does take Propofol on a regular basis, they will build up resistance. So I know some reports say it is a two-months supply. It depends how much resistance was in his body. It may only be a one week supply. We don't know.\nLEMON: Is there something we should be concerned about? I heard during the testimony that it is usually a doctor/patient relationship, and maybe this was an employee/employer relationship. Is that a concern to society overall in this case and in society, this culture where you see drugs on television and what have you?\nCAIN: To my opinion, there is a fundamental difference in the Western society versus other societies in the relations between doctor/patient. I think we need to go back to the basics and say doctors are here to take care of patients. It's not a question of you paying me for something. We are not the same as lawyers, to my opinion. We are doctors. Our first sworn duty is to take care of you. Money is secondary. We really need to take care your well being, regardless of how much you will pay for me.\nLEMON: Thank you, doctor.\nCAIN: You're welcome.\nLEMON: Dr. Zeev Cain. My thanks to him at the University of California, Irvine. Stay with CNN. There's more ahead next hour on Dr. Murray's trial. Legal analyst, Holly Hughes, will join me to explain what we can expect when testimony resumes on Monday. Coming up, the return of skulls to the place they belong gives a morbid history lesson. The first time in the 20th century one nation tried to erase the existence of a people.",

That's the bottom line.\\nLEMON: So, listen, people are -- this is going to be the issue now with medicine. How much can you get from doctors, depending on how much you pay? Your celebrity status? What you do for a living? All of that, is that at issue here?\\nCAIN: Absolutely, it is. Remember, they found four gallons. Four gallons are enough to put to sleep about 500 people. Or it is enough to keep somebody asleep for eight hours for almost two months. Now, that may be a bit misleading, because he may have built resistance in his body already. We have to remember, when somebody does take Propofol on a regular basis, they will build up resistance. So I know some reports say it is a two-months supply. It depends how much resistance was in his body. It may only be a one week supply. We don't know.\\nLEMON: Is there something we should be concerned about? I heard during the testimony that it is usually a doctor/patient relationship, and maybe this was an employee/employer relationship. Is that a concern to society overall in this case and in society, this culture where you see drugs on television and what have you?\\nCAIN: To my opinion, there is a fundamental difference in the Western society versus other societies in the relations between doctor/patient. I think we need to go back to the basics and say doctors are here to take care of patients. It's not a question of you paying me for something. We are not the same as lawyers, to my opinion. We are doctors. Our first sworn duty is to take care of you. Money is secondary.

That's a lot of drugs.\nLEMON: Enough to kill someone?\nCAIN: Certainly enough to make sure that he stopped breathing, yes.\nLEMON: Yes.

    "source": "BLITZER: Connecticut state police confirm today, just a little while ago indeed, that Adam Lanza fired what they call hundreds of bullet, hundreds, at the Sandy Hook Elementary school on Friday and you a number of weapons with him. We are live from the Lanza home, in just a moment with that investigation, standby for that. Also, we are awaiting the arrival of President Obama. He is due here in Newtown shortly. He is going to speak with the families of the 26 people, most of them elementary school children who were shot dead Friday morning. Stay with CNN for that. You will see the president live right here when he arrives. And of course, that interfaith vigil, the entirety, all of it we will bring it to you live. Let's go out to the home where Adam Lanza lived with his mother that home is also right now a crime scene because it appears in Lanza's mother was killed -- killed in the home before the shooting rampage over at the elementary school. CNN's Alison Kosik is joining us now from the Lanza home. Alison, the state police, Connecticut state police, they just gave us an update. For those of the viewers weren't watching CNN live, tell us the main points that the police made.\nALISON KOSIK, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The state police say that Adam Lanza shot and killed his mother, shooting her multiple times inside the house that is in this neighborhood where I'm standing right now. Police still have the street leading up to his house blocked off. You know, there hasn't been much activity since yesterday afternoon, up until about -- I would say a little over an hour ago, we watched about six police cars drive up several officials got out of their car, talked a built and then got back in the cars and drove off, we assume to Adam Lanza's house. Now, what we did learn throughout the day from state police is that their focus is really was on this school. And what they found was that four weapons were found at the school, three were found in the classroom a shotgun was found in Lanza's car that was parked outside the school. We also learned that Lanza mostly used a semiautomatic weapon called a Bushmaster inside the school to kill those 26 people inside the school. He had, as you said, he shot dozens of bullets and he had hundreds of unused ammunition as well, hundreds of bullets that were not even used. So, it was clear why the medical examiner came out yesterday and explained how Adam Lanza shot those 26 people multiple times, some of them, he shot, said the medical examiner, three to 11 times. It's clear that Lanza carrying that much ammunition on him was looking to cause the most destruction and death - Wolf.\nBLITZER: What a horrific, horrific crime. Alison, thank you so much. So, what happened Friday will make Monday, certainly, a huge challenge for so many families. Let's bring in our chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta who is here with us now. Posttraumatic stress disorder that is going to be a huge problem.\nDR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: It is. And you know, we are used to talking about this in the context over adults but it can happen in children and it can happen quickly. I think that's two things people don't always realize. And you know, how the children behave now, how a lot of these things are implemented that you've been talking about with people over the last couple of days, is going to make a big difference, if certain conversations had had. If special care is taken to make sure that children are sleeping well, for example. They are going to be able to cope much better in the long runs. So, you can predict, you know, certain likelihood of success in terms of that coping by what's happening the next few days.\nBLITZER: We think of posttraumatic stress disorder, troops coming home from Afghanistan or Iraq. This is obviously very different than that. But, what are the symptoms? What should we be looking forward to? This is a very serious illness.\nGUPTA: In adults, you know, you think about things like hyper vigilance, difficulty sleeping, very quick and almost hasty reaction. In children, it can be very different. Sometimes don't verbalize it hard late all, changes in how they play. They may, in fact, start playing, you know, toy guns or something like that if they didn't before. They can have regression. So, a 6-year-old can start acting like a younger child, for example. And again, just paying attention to those things and not sort of glossing over, obviously don't want to provide graphic details, make sure you are having conversations. Tomorrow, kids go back to school. They don't know about what happened yet, they probably will by tomorrow.\nBLITZER: I'm sure they will. And if their parents didn't tell them, teachers might tell them or their classmates would tell them.\nGUPTA: Social media.\nBLITZER: Yes. They will hear about. And Sanjay is going to be with us throughout the night. We are awaiting the president of the United States. He is coming here to Newtown to bring some comfort to the families, the first responders. Also, he will participate in the interfaith vigil that will be taking place here in Connecticut. Our coverage continues right after this.",

He had, as you said, he shot dozens of bullets and he had hundreds of unused ammunition as well, hundreds of bullets that were not even used. So, it was clear why the medical examiner came out yesterday and explained how Adam Lanza shot those 26 people multiple times, some of them, he shot, said the medical examiner, three to 11 times. It's clear that Lanza carrying that much ammunition on him was looking to cause the most destruction and death - Wolf.\\nBLITZER: What a horrific, horrific crime. Alison, thank you so much. So, what happened Friday will make Monday, certainly, a huge challenge for so many families. Let's bring in our chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta who is here with us now. Posttraumatic stress disorder that is going to be a huge problem.\\nDR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: It is. And you know, we are used to talking about this in the context over adults but it can happen in children and it can happen quickly. I think that's two things people don't always realize. And you know, how the children behave now, how a lot of these things are implemented that you've been talking about with people over the last couple of days, is going to make a big difference, if certain conversations had had. If special care is taken to make sure that children are sleeping well, for example. They are going to be able to cope much better in the long runs. So, you can predict, you know, certain likelihood of success in terms of that coping by what's happening the next few days.\\nBLITZER: We think of posttraumatic stress disorder, troops coming home from Afghanistan or Iraq. This is obviously very different than that. But, what are the symptoms? What should we be looking forward to? This is a very serious illness.\\nGUPTA: In adults, you know, you think about things like hyper vigilance, difficulty sleeping, very quick and almost hasty reaction. In children, it can be very different. Sometimes don't verbalize it hard late all, changes in how they play. They may, in fact, start playing, you know, toy guns or something like that if they didn't before. They can have regression. So, a 6-year-old can start acting like a younger child, for example. And again, just paying attention to those things and not sort of glossing over, obviously don't want to provide graphic details, make sure you are having conversations. Tomorrow, kids go back to school. They don't know about what happened yet, they probably will by tomorrow.\\nBLITZER: I'm sure they will. And if their parents didn't tell them, teachers might tell them or their classmates would tell them.\\nGUPTA: Social media.\\nBLITZER: Yes. They will hear about. And Sanjay is going to be with us throughout the night. We are awaiting the president of the United States. He is coming here to Newtown to bring some comfort to the families, the first responders. Also, he will participate in the interfaith vigil that will be taking place here in Connecticut. Our coverage continues right after this.\""

    "source": "SAMBOLIN: Welcome back. Fifteen minutes past the hour. We are following breaking news this morning. It is a shocking story involving the blade runner, Olympic and Paralympic track superstar Oscar Pistorius. He is at the police station in south Africa right now after his model girlfriend was shot and killed inside his home. Police are saying a 26-year-old man has been arrested. They are not confirming that it is Pistorius, although it is important to note that Pistorius is 26 years old. We are also finding out about previous incidents at his home of a domestic nature. Pistorius, who is a double amputee, reached the 400-meter semifinals in the London Games last year. He races with carbon blades because of a birth defect.\nBERMAN: To New York now where first it was calorie counts on menus, then trans fats, then mega soft drinks. Now, Mayor Michael Bloomberg is out to ban Styrofoam food packaging in stores. It's actually not Styrofoam technically, it's plastic foam. He's looking to ban that in stores and food restaurants. Bloomberg will unveil the plan today in his final State of the City speech.\nSAMBOLIN: And, boy, did you feel that breeze? Look at this. A boxer has suspended for allegedly taking a dive 13 seconds into a fight against former NFL defensive end Ray Edwards. Look at this, the phantom upper cut misses his much smaller opponent Nick \"Turbo Tax\" Capes by about a foot. But he sells it, literally knocking himself off his own feet. Reports say \"Turbo Tax\" --\nBERMAN: That is insane, I'm sorry. It is nowhere near him.\nSAMBOLIN: I know. But it looked right. So, if you're far away.\nBERMAN: Two miles away.\nSAMBOLIN: \"Turbo Tax\" was a last-minute replacement for a couple of no-show boxers. North Dakota's fight governing body is reviewing that right there. It won't take long to jump into a conclusion dare, I say, right?\nBERMAN: Not a tough one to review. Everyone waking up to a huge business story, a massive deal in the airline industry. U.S. Airways and bankrupt American Airlines have agreed to a merger.\nSAMBOLIN: But what does it mean for you, the flier? Christine Romans has details in \"Road Warriors\".\nCHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Because it's all about us in the end, isn't it? The goal is a more efficient, more profitable airline, but that's going to take some time. Airline mergers generally take a few years, so for now get ready for some logistical headaches. One analyst we talked to says the bigger the merger, the more problems there are. First, combining the computer systems isn't easy. So, there could be some reservation problems initially. We can look at one of the most recent mergers for a clue. United and Continental -- in January, 2012, the first month the government combined data of those carriers, it showed customer complaints shot up 198 percent. Most of the complaints are about flight problems, cancellations, delays and reservations and ticketing problems. These two airlines also have to combine their frequent flier programs. They're going to have to woo back business travelers that American lost with all of those canceled flights this fall because of a pilot sickout. Here's travel expert Mark Murphy on some of the benefits of the deal.\nMARK MURPHY, TRAVEL EXPERT: This merger will provide the traveler with better connections. I think you're going to be in nine major hubs between the two carriers now with the merger. So you're going to be able to get where you want to go more efficiently and effectively.\nROMANS: All right. So those nine major hubs are all over the country giving people a lot of access. Look at where they are. Not a lot of overlap. Really the only overlap in Chicago and Phoenix. Because of that and because the economy is still weak, many travel experts are telling us that ticket prices probably won't go up. Now, we should also point out that sources close to the boards have told us that the boards have agreed there's a lot of work to do here. An announcement today likely and then we'll wait to se what the bankruptcy judge says and what federal regulators say about this big, big deal.\nBERMAN: Usually changes need to be made before it's finalized but they manage to push it through.\nROMANS: That's right. Absolutely.\nSAMBOLIN: John pointed out perhaps they could double our miles. So --\nROMANS: No details on your frequent flier plan but I will find out as soon as this deal is official.\nSAMBOLIN: We appreciate that. Thank you. All right. Nineteen minutes past the hour. Coming up, lots of folks watching the news of that Carnival cruise ship limping back to port today. Christine Romans is coming back to tell us what you need to know if you are holding tickets for a cruise.",

    "topic": "Medical condition of survivor",
    "source": "MICHAELA PEREIRA, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back to NEW DAY. Medical professionals remain shocked that a 15-year-old boy can survive a 5- 1/2 hour flight from California all the way to Hawaii in the wheel well of a Boeing 767. Although it is very rare, the teen would not be the first to live through this kind of journey. Back in 2000, a man survived a 7-1/2-hour flight from Tahiti to Los Angeles in the wheel well of a plane. Joining me now is the very physician who successfully treated that stowaway, Dr. Armand Dorian. Dr. Dorian, what a pleasure to have you here. Why don't you describe to us the condition of the stowaway survivor that presented to you in the E.R. back in 2000?\nDR. ARMAND DORIAN, USC VERDUGO HILLS HOSPITAL: Back in 2000, the patient that rolled in by paramedics was not in the same state as this young boy this year. He was literally frozen, almost cartoonishly frozen. His arms were kind of jutted out. He was moaning. He was unconscious. He was not alert. We had to do multiple critical measures to keep him alive. His core body temperature was below 80 degrees. We had to intubate him, put chest tubes in. It was really touch and go.\nPEREIRA: It was really a miracle that he survived in your estimation?\nDORIAN: There's no question. I thought in my lifetime I would never even hear of another case like this, let alone hear of a case where the gentleman who was a stowaway walks away from the incident.\nPEREIRA: Let's get to that. You already compared the difference between that. Quickly, before we move on, do you know if that man had lasting side effects? Oftentimes you don't know the results many years later. Do you know?\nDORIAN: Actually he had no gross motor dysfunction, so something may actually be -- later on that may come up like depression, chronic headaches, but nothing obvious at the time when he was discharged from the hospital. Know that it was a month after he was admitted.\nPEREIRA: Interesting. OK, to this 15-year-old, he essentially after an hour after the plane landed sort of came out of the wheel well mostly able to move on his own power. This is phenomenal. Talk to me about what you think happened that this young man would present in a very different condition than the man in 2000.\nDORIAN: I mean, the planets all were aligned. This was a perfect storm of disaster that actually probably saved his life because when the airplane ascends, you lose oxygen, the air gets thin as we would say in layman's terms. You would pass out in about a minute after being up there. Also, the temperature drops. With the temperature dropping it actually starts slowing down your body's need for oxygen. It puts you in a frozen or some people termed it as a suspended state. Kind of like a cryogenic freezing that we've seen, you know, sci-fi or hear about in the future happening and because your demand decreases, you don't need as much oxygen. You can be suspended in time until your oxygen is replenished.\nPEREIRA: We know your patient passed out and doesn't remember a thing of his flight. We don't what this young boy remembers. We know that he did tell police that he was unconscious for a time. What do you think it feels like for all of this to go on or do we know that because most people don't have a memory of it?\nDORIAN: I'm pretty sure he's not going to have any memory or recollection of it. He's going to probably remember the adrenaline rush of trying to hide inside that wheel well, the beginning of that takeoff, and then about a minute max, 5 minutes after that takeoff he's unconscious. The next thing he remembers, he's waking up and he's landed already. Maybe he thinks he didn't take off. He passed out and is in a completely different place.\nPEREIRA: How unusual is it, Dr. Dorian, for a person to survive subzero temperatures, lack of oxygen for 5-1/2 hours and also that he didn't fall out of the landing gear.\nDORIAN: I kind of describe it as winning the lottery five times in a row. The fashion in which he did it, I would think it was a poor TV show production if they had a kid walk out of a wheel well like this. It's really mind-boggling.\nPEREIRA: The story he was telling us, he was trying to get home to Somalia to see his mother. You can imagine the heartbreak. You can imagine the concern the family has. Hopefully he'll get medical attention to deal with any issues that come up after this. Dr. Dorian, what a pleasure to talk to you. Some miracles stories we are talking about. Thanks for joining us from Los Angeles -- Chris.\nCUOMO: That just does not make sense. I don't know how that kid managed to not have any effects of such extreme conditions. Let's take a little break on NEW DAY to consider it. When we come back, an object of interest on the shoreline of Western Australia. Could it be debris from Flight 370?\nBOLDUAN: The death toll continues to rise in the South Korean ferry disaster. Why did so many victims fail to get out alive? We'll take you inside a simulator to get a better understanding of the life-or- death emergency at sea.",

Medical professionals remain shocked that a 15-year-old boy can survive a 5- 1/2 hour flight from California all the way to Hawaii in the wheel well of a Boeing 767. Although it is very rare, the teen would not be the first to live through this kind of journey. Back in 2000, a man survived a 7-1/2-hour flight from Tahiti to Los Angeles in the wheel well of a plane. Joining me now is the very physician who successfully treated that stowaway, Dr. Armand Dorian. Dr. Dorian, what a pleasure to have you here. Why don't you describe to us the condition of the stowaway survivor that presented to you in the E.R. back in 2000?\nDR. ARMAND DORIAN, USC VERDUGO HILLS HOSPITAL: Back in 2000, the patient that rolled in by paramedics was not in the same state as this young boy this year. He was literally frozen, almost cartoonishly frozen. His arms were kind of jutted out. He was moaning. He was unconscious. He was not alert. We had to do multiple critical measures to keep him alive. His core body temperature was below 80 degrees. We had to intubate him, put chest tubes in. It was really touch and go.\nPEREIRA: It was really a miracle that he survived in your estimation?\nDORIAN: There's no question. I thought in my lifetime I would never even hear of another case like this, let alone hear of a case where the gentleman who was a stowaway walks away from the incident.\nPEREIRA: Let's get to that. You already compared the difference between that. Quickly, before we move on, do you know if that man had lasting side effects? Oftentimes you don't know the results many years later. Do you know?\nDORIAN: Actually he had no gross motor dysfunction, so something may actually be -- later on that may come up like depression, chronic headaches, but nothing obvious at the time when he was discharged from the hospital. Know that it was a month after he was admitted.\nPEREIRA: Interesting. OK, to this 15-year-old, he essentially after an hour after the plane landed sort of came out of the wheel well mostly able to move on his own power. This is phenomenal. Talk to me about what you think happened that this young man would present in a very different condition than the man in 2000.\nDORIAN: I mean, the planets all were aligned. This was a perfect storm of disaster that actually probably saved his life because when the airplane ascends, you lose oxygen, the air gets thin as we would say in layman's terms.

    "source": "BERMAN: Tensions building in Scotland this morning and much of the United Kingdom as voters get ready for an historic vote on whether to split from the rest of the United Kingdom. Tomorrow's vote could see Scots declare independence, potentially splitting up Great Britain after 300 years. Now, some U.K. officials in Britain are pledging to give Scots new powers in an effort to sway a vote against independence. I want go to Max Foster right now who has the latest from Edinburgh. And, Max, these polls are so, so close.\nMAX FOSTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, three out today, John, and they're all too close to call. And you can really tell the story here from Edinburgh, by looking at the front pages of the newspapers. So, one of the polls on \"Scotsmen\" saying the polls has \"no\" in the land. But actually the \"yes\" campaign is closing the gap. And \"The Herald\", the only newspaper in Scotland supporting the \"yes\" campaign, is making the point that yes the pro-independent campaign is closing the gap and has the momentum and could overtake no by tomorrow. That's the suggestion, at least. Very clear on the front of \"The Daily Mail\", 24 hours to save Britain or to go independent. It really is a date with destiny tomorrow. We talked a bit about how there's a lot of attention to the run-up to tomorrow's poll. You know, this has been two years of campaigning and a lot of aggression, particularly on the yes side. And a very simple message here, keep the heat and carry on. That's the Scottish play on keep calm and carry campaigning, and to keep things calm really, because it is pretty tense here at the moment.\nBERMAN: Max, I think we have about a thousand questions here in the United States for you about this referendum. Can't possibly ask them all the time we have. But let me ask one that I think is surprising to many Americans. Scots want independence, they want to break away. But they want to keep the queen. They want to keep the monarchy. It seems as if they don't quite under this independence thing.\nFOSTER: I think this is a huge thing for the queen. I mean, she only came close to commenting. She can't get involved in politics. You know, she has to stay above politics. That's her constitutional rule. But she did say to a churchgoer recently she really hope that Scots consider this. You can imagine there was a very big British empire. Empires come and go. And the empire's really been cut back, of course. But now, you're talking about home turf, and her home state being split. I think she's pretty concerned about this. We have to say, in all essence, we're not talking about a big change in her role in Scotland, because the yes campaign they do want to keep her as head of state. But I certainly think that she's concerned about what's happening here. A breakup of the U.K., it's a huge moment in British history.\nBERMAN: It would be colossal, after more than 300 years, that vote is tomorrow. If they do vote to split, it would take 18 months to implement. Max Foster, great to have you here for us this morning. Thanks so much.\nROMANS: Big questions before the referendum of what a yes vote could mean for both economies. Harvard economist Ken Rogoff told me there are a lot of unknowns, the biggest being currency.\nKENNETH ROGOFF, PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS, HARVARD UNIVERSITY: When you got through with this divorce, suddenly you don't have the currency. What currency do you have? That's one of the first questions people will have, it's one of the first questions investors have. You really don't have an answer. They say it's the pound. The British say it's not the pound. People say, well, maybe Scotland will join the euro. That creates a lot of problems for the rest of the eurozone. And they could have their own currency, but that's not a magic elixir when you don't have long credibility.\nROMANS: It's a really big deal. Rogoff also said a yes vote could be -- maybe good for Scotland in the long run, he said like in a hundred years. But it's the short term uncertainly that is so concerning about this. He said, basically, it would be a mild negative for the U.K. and very big -- very big negative for Scotland. He also said, look, when Americans say why does this matter to me? I've heard this, why do I care? He says, because the U.K. and U.S. have the strongest alliance in the world. And this is our best friend breaking apart. It's a very big deal.\nBERMAN: It has huge implications for international relations as well. Again, what do you do to every other separatist movement in the world?\nROMANS: To say nothing of America's nuclear position in northern Europe, it's in Scotland.\nBERMAN: Fascinating. It will all be decided tomorrow. Twenty-seven minutes after the hour. Could U.S. troops end up fighting on the ground against ISIS? A new warning from a top U.S. general as there is skepticism now about the president's plan to battle the terrorists. We're live next.",

That's the suggestion, at least. Very clear on the front of \\\"The Daily Mail\\\", 24 hours to save Britain or to go independent. It really is a date with destiny tomorrow. We talked a bit about how there's a lot of attention to the run-up to tomorrow's poll. You know, this has been two years of campaigning and a lot of aggression, particularly on the yes side. And a very simple message here, keep the heat and carry on. That's the Scottish play on keep calm and carry campaigning, and to keep things calm really, because it is pretty tense here at the moment.\\nBERMAN: Max, I think we have about a thousand questions here in the United States for you about this referendum. Can't possibly ask them all the time we have. But let me ask one that I think is surprising to many Americans. Scots want independence, they want to break away. But they want to keep the queen. They want to keep the monarchy. It seems as if they don't quite under this independence thing.\\nFOSTER: I think this is a huge thing for the queen. I mean, she only came close to commenting. She can't get involved in politics. You know, she has to stay above politics. That's her constitutional rule. But she did say to a churchgoer recently she really hope that Scots consider this. You can imagine there was a very big British empire. Empires come and go. And the empire's really been cut back, of course. But now, you're talking about home turf, and her home state being split. I think she's pretty concerned about this. We have to say, in all essence, we're not talking about a big change in her role in Scotland, because the yes campaign they do want to keep her as head of state. But I certainly think that she's concerned about what's happening here. A breakup of the U.K., it's a huge moment in British history.\\nBERMAN: It would be colossal, after more than 300 years, that vote is tomorrow. If they do vote to split, it would take 18 months to implement. Max Foster, great to have you here for us this morning. Thanks so much.\\nROMANS: Big questions before the referendum of what a yes vote could mean for both economies. Harvard economist Ken Rogoff told me there are a lot of unknowns, the biggest being currency.\\nKENNETH ROGOFF, PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS, HARVARD UNIVERSITY: When you got through with this divorce, suddenly you don't have the currency. What currency do you have? That's one of the first questions people will have, it's one of the first questions investors have. You really don't have an answer. They say it's the pound. The British say it's not the pound. People say, well, maybe Scotland will join the euro. That creates a lot of problems for the rest of the eurozone. And they could have their own currency, but that's not a magic elixir when you don't have long credibility.\\nROMANS: It's a really big deal. Rogoff also said a yes vote could be -- maybe good for Scotland in the long run, he said like in a hundred years. But it's the short term uncertainly that is so concerning about this. He said, basically, it would be a mild negative for the U.K. and very big -- very big negative for Scotland. He also said, look, when Americans say why does this matter to me? I've heard this, why do I care? He says, because the U.K. and U.S. have the strongest alliance in the world. And this is our best friend breaking apart. It's a very big deal.\\nBERMAN: It has huge implications for international relations as well.

    "topic": "Airlines' commitment to service improvements",
    "source": "CAROL LIN, CNN ANCHOR: Well, the government is also about to tell us what airline passengers already know: that the service is less than perfect, even after the nation's carriers promised to upgrade service. A report comes from the Transportation Department's inspector general in less than four hours. And we are joined by a travel expert, Terry Trippler, in Minneapolis. Terry, I wonder if you've been flying lately because you got a chance at least to peak at the preliminary reports. What are we likely to hear?\nTERRY TRIPPLER, TRAVEL EXPERT: I think what we're going to see is something similar to the interim report that came out in June of last year: improvement, but a long way to go. And I think that's what we're going to have happen again. We're going to see this noon.\nLIN: Well, let's touch on at least some of the promises that the airlines said that they would try to work on. For example, when I go ahead and I book my ticket, am I guaranteed that the airline is going to quote me the cheapest fair?\nTRIPPLER: That's a tough one, Carol. They have promised to do that. Some of the airlines are making pretty good on that promise. Other ones aren't doing too well. Basically, where the problem lies is in these last-minute Internet fares that they have that -- there are some passengers claim they're not being told about. So there needs to be some improvement on that area.\nLIN: All right. Well, what are -- are they going to be able to tell me -- or will they tell me if the flight is oversold as I book my seat?\nTRIPPLER: If you ask, from what I gather, they are telling you if the flight is oversold. What we find happening on this one is, once the passenger is finding the flight is oversold, they book on that flight because they want to get voluntarily bumped and get the miles and the money and the meals, etcetera. So that one sort of backfired on them.\nLIN: All right, let's say they lose my luggage. How long is it going to take for me to get it back these days?\nTRIPPLER: They claim they'll do it in 24 hours. Luggage complaints are up. And, of course, we recently all have seen the film of where the luggage handlers were playing basketball with people's packages, his luggage. That did not help. Complaints are up. They're going to have to do a better job on luggage.\nLIN: All right, well, also, I find myself more often than not sitting on a plane, getting ready to taxi the runway, and suddenly everything comes to a halt. And I'm told that it is problems with air traffic control or something that really doesn't mean much to me as a passenger. Am I going to be told, or should I be told -- am I being told why I'm being delayed specifically?\nTRIPPLER: Well, they say they are telling you. And here's where the big problem lies. And these are the complaints that I am receiving by the literally hundreds per day in e-mails. People feel they're not being told the truth. They're not being told before they board the aircraft that there's a possibility that they'll be delayed. I mean, people are boarding aircraft -- I did, I boarded one, went out and sat at the end of the tarmac. I was there long enough to qualify to vote in that precinct. They've got to do a better job on this. Get out of the gate. Get off the ground.\nLIN: So if they're not quite meeting the promises that they said that they would keep to Congress, does this mean that Congress will or should go ahead with legislation to force the airlines to give better service?\nTRIPPLER: Well, Carol, I think that, as soon as this report is issued, that we're going to have people lined up all the way around the Capitol to file a bill for passenger-rights legislation. Already we have one or two of the 1999 bills that have been resurrected. Those were bills that were put aside when the airlines promised to do a better job. Yes, I think the airlines, unfortunately -- and I'm a free-enterprise person -- but, unfortunately, I think the airlines have forfeited their right to operate without some type of government intervention. I think it's inevitable. It's got to happen.\nLIN: Well, and some airlines are going to say that so many factors are out of their control: like weather and now labor problems. Delta's pilots are expected to announce today what they voted on Friday: whether they're actually going to go on strike.\nTRIPPLER: That's right. And we're talking Northwest now, Delta. Before the year's over, we're going to be talking to American and United. And I disagree with the airlines there. I believe those are in their control. Weather, I understand. Labor: Come on, airlines, let's get it together.\nLIN: All right, thank you very much for that preview. It really makes you want to hit the road, doesn't it?\nLIN: Thanks, Mr. Trippler.\nTRIPPLER: Thank you.",

What are we likely to hear?\\nTERRY TRIPPLER, TRAVEL EXPERT: I think what we're going to see is something similar to the interim report that came out in June of last year: improvement, but a long way to go. And I think that's what we're going to have happen again. We're going to see this noon.\\nLIN: Well, let's touch on at least some of the promises that the airlines said that they would try to work on. For example, when I go ahead and I book my ticket, am I guaranteed that the airline is going to quote me the cheapest fair?\\nTRIPPLER: That's a tough one, Carol. They have promised to do that. Some of the airlines are making pretty good on that promise. Other ones aren't doing too well. Basically, where the problem lies is in these last-minute Internet fares that they have that -- there are some passengers claim they're not being told about. So there needs to be some improvement on that area.\\nLIN: All right. Well, what are -- are they going to be able to tell me -- or will they tell me if the flight is oversold as I book my seat?\\nTRIPPLER: If you ask, from what I gather, they are telling you if the flight is oversold. What we find happening on this one is, once the passenger is finding the flight is oversold, they book on that flight because they want to get voluntarily bumped and get the miles and the money and the meals, etcetera. So that one sort of backfired on them.\\nLIN: All right, let's say they lose my luggage. How long is it going to take for me to get it back these days?\\nTRIPPLER: They claim they'll do it in 24 hours. Luggage complaints are up. And, of course, we recently all have seen the film of where the luggage handlers were playing basketball with people's packages, his luggage. That did not help. Complaints are up. They're going to have to do a better job on luggage.\\nLIN: All right, well, also, I find myself more often than not sitting on a plane, getting ready to taxi the runway, and suddenly everything comes to a halt. And I'm told that it is problems with air traffic control or something that really doesn't mean much to me as a passenger. Am I going to be told, or should I be told -- am I being told why I'm being delayed specifically?\\nTRIPPLER: Well, they say they are telling you. And here's where the big problem lies. And these are the complaints that I am receiving by the literally hundreds per day in e-mails. People feel they're not being told the truth. They're not being told before they board the aircraft that there's a possibility that they'll be delayed. I mean, people are boarding aircraft -- I did, I boarded one, went out and sat at the end of the tarmac. I was there long enough to qualify to vote in that precinct. They've got to do a better job on this. Get out of the gate. Get off the ground.\\nLIN: So if they're not quite meeting the promises that they said that they would keep to Congress, does this mean that Congress will or should go ahead with legislation to force the airlines to give better service?\\nTRIPPLER: Well, Carol, I think that, as soon as this report is issued, that we're going to have people lined up all the way around the Capitol to file a bill for passenger-rights legislation. Already we have one or two of the 1999 bills that have been resurrected. Those were bills that were put aside when the airlines promised to do a better job. Yes, I think the airlines, unfortunately -- and I'm a free-enterprise person -- but, unfortunately, I think the airlines have forfeited their right to operate without some type of government intervention. I think it's inevitable. It's got to happen.\\nLIN: Well, and some airlines are going to say that so many factors are out of their control: like weather and now labor problems. Delta's pilots are expected to announce today what they voted on Friday: whether they're actually going to go on strike.\\nTRIPPLER: That's right. And we're talking Northwest now, Delta. Before the year's over, we're going to be talking to American and United. And I disagree with the airlines there. I believe those are in their control. Weather, I understand. Labor: Come on, airlines, let's get it together.\\nLIN: All right, thank you very much for that preview. It really makes you want to hit the road, doesn't it?\\nLIN: Thanks, Mr. Trippler.\\nTRIPPLER: Thank you.\""

    "source": "WHITFIELD: All right. The U.S. flag raised above the American embassy in Havana for the first time in 54 years. The U.S. and Cuba marking their resumption of diplomatic relations. But what happens now between the two countries? Joining me from Houston, CNN presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, and in New York, Stephen Schlesinger, a fellow at the Century Foundation, whose father Arthur Schlesinger worked in and wrote extensively about the Kennedy White House. Good to see both of you.\nDOUGLAS BRINKLEY, CNN PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN: Thank you.\nSTEPHEN SCHLESINGER, ADJUNCT FELLOW, CENTURY FOUNDATION: Nice to see you.\nWHITFIELD: All right. So, Stephen, to you first. You know, what was that moment like for you, and did your dad ever talk about possibly seeing that kind of day, or that day happening, like what we saw yesterday?\nSCHLESINGER: I think he always wanted this day to happen. I don't think he would have realized it was going to take another 50 years. You know, it's quite remarkable. Ten presidents I believe have been in office since the embargo was instituted against Cuba. Finally, we have a president who made a breakthrough and it's a very impressive turnaround, and I think it will pay very much dividends, both with our relationship with Cuba as well as with the entire Latin American community.\nWHITFIELD: And so, Douglas, you know, this ceremony was full of symbolism, you know, from the U.S. Marines involved 54 years ago, taking the flag down, to now being the ones to help raise the flag. Apparently the cane that Secretary of State, you know, Kerry was walking on also had its significance there. How important was this moment to set a tone, so to speak, of how these two countries will be working together this day forward?\nBRINKLEY: Well, it's a very important tone-setting moment for John Kerry. It's one of the high watermarks of his tenure as secretary of state. Barack Obama will most likely get very high marks in history for kind of healing U.S.-Cuban relations. But we've got to be cautious here. Embassies can open and they can close. We had an embassy in Venezuela, in Caracas, running and then we shut it down. We'll have to see. We're not -- the friendship with the United States and Cuba is not ironclad at this juncture. There's still human rights issues. And if we ever find out that Cuba is in some ways sponsoring terrorism against the United States, things could dissolve. But for the moment, as Stephen Schlesinger said, this is a very healing moment after this many decades of the United States and Cuba at each other's throats. It looks like now a friendship is blooming.\nWHITFIELD: And blooming in what way do you see, Stephen? Because yes, unfinished business. We're still talking about, you know, an embargo that has yet to be lifted. It takes an act of Congress in order for that to happen. But what do you see next in the short term as opposed to the long term?\nSCHLESINGER: Well, I think there are going to be a series of small steps. I think Doug is quite right that -- you know, Cuba is not going to change overnight. In fact, it may not change for years. So the small steps are important. I think right now Secretary Kerry has been talking about some of them. For example, dealing with narcotics interdiction, or the environment, or issues of financial transactions or agriculture or telecommunications. All those issues are pretty straightforward and can be dealt with in a bilateral basis. But when you get into the issues of human rights, the settlement of expropriated property of Cubans and Americans, and issues of democracy, it's -- you're talking about a much longer-term situation.\nWHITFIELD: And then, Douglas, you know, just listening to the ceremony and listening to the -- whether it be the poet or even Secretary Kerry, some beautiful, you know, words that were being used. And when using language like, you know, as two peoples who are no longer enemies or rivals, but neighbors playing the Cuban national anthem first, and then later playing, you know, the U.S. national anthem. In what way do you see those as, you know, significant moves in order to really kind of thaw the ice?\nBRINKLEY: Well, I think the Cuban people and the American people have a shared rich history. And so one of the ways that the ice thawing is going to happen are cultural exchanges. Students going down to Cuba now. People going to do tourism. I went down to Cuba just to see the sight of the Bay of Pigs invasion. And went to see where Theodore Roosevelt's, you know, history down there. It's an amazing place, Havana. So I think the influx of American tourists going to Cuba is going to be quite remarkable. And when people start talking and dialoguing, sharing music, food, it's a chance for these two countries to get much closer. And also Fidel Castro is on his last legs, so to speak. And Raul Castro has shown more of an -- shown signs that he liked to get along with the United States. So for some people that remember the Cuban missile crisis, this is really a moment to celebrate when tensions are at an all-time low right now.\nWHITFIELD: Yes, neither of the Castros were there, but, you know, their aura, indeed.\nWHITFIELD: You know, is certainly in the vicinity.\nBRINKLEY: Yes.\nWHITFIELD: Stephen Schlesinger and Douglas Brinkley, thanks to both of you. Appreciate it.\nBRINKLEY: Thanks.\nSCHLESINGER: Thank you.\nWHITFIELD: All right. We'll be right back.",

Joining me from Houston, CNN presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, and in New York, Stephen Schlesinger, a fellow at the Century Foundation, whose father Arthur Schlesinger worked in and wrote extensively about the Kennedy White House. Good to see both of you.\\nDOUGLAS BRINKLEY, CNN PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN: Thank you.\\nSTEPHEN SCHLESINGER, ADJUNCT FELLOW, CENTURY FOUNDATION: Nice to see you.\\nWHITFIELD: All right. So, Stephen, to you first. You know, what was that moment like for you, and did your dad ever talk about possibly seeing that kind of day, or that day happening, like what we saw yesterday?\\nSCHLESINGER: I think he always wanted this day to happen. I don't think he would have realized it was going to take another 50 years. You know, it's quite remarkable. Ten presidents I believe have been in office since the embargo was instituted against Cuba. Finally, we have a president who made a breakthrough and it's a very impressive turnaround, and I think it will pay very much dividends, both with our relationship with Cuba as well as with the entire Latin American community.\\nWHITFIELD: And so, Douglas, you know, this ceremony was full of symbolism, you know, from the U.S. Marines involved 54 years ago, taking the flag down, to now being the ones to help raise the flag. Apparently the cane that Secretary of State, you know, Kerry was walking on also had its significance there. How important was this moment to set a tone, so to speak, of how these two countries will be working together this day forward?\\nBRINKLEY: Well, it's a very important tone-setting moment for John Kerry. It's one of the high watermarks of his tenure as secretary of state. Barack Obama will most likely get very high marks in history for kind of healing U.S.-Cuban relations. But we've got to be cautious here. Embassies can open and they can close. We had an embassy in Venezuela, in Caracas, running and then we shut it down. We'll have to see. We're not -- the friendship with the United States and Cuba is not ironclad at this juncture. There's still human rights issues. And if we ever find out that Cuba is in some ways sponsoring terrorism against the United States, things could dissolve. But for the moment, as Stephen Schlesinger said, this is a very healing moment after this many decades of the United States and Cuba at each other's throats. It looks like now a friendship is blooming.\\nWHITFIELD: And blooming in what way do you see, Stephen? Because yes, unfinished business. We're still talking about, you know, an embargo that has yet to be lifted. It takes an act of Congress in order for that to happen. But what do you see next in the short term as opposed to the long term?\\nSCHLESINGER: Well, I think there are going to be a series of small steps. I think Doug is quite right that -- you know, Cuba is not going to change overnight. In fact, it may not change for years. So the small steps are important. I think right now Secretary Kerry has been talking about some of them. For example, dealing with narcotics interdiction, or the environment, or issues of financial transactions or agriculture or telecommunications. All those issues are pretty straightforward and can be dealt with in a bilateral basis. But when you get into the issues of human rights, the settlement of expropriated property of Cubans and Americans, and issues of democracy, it's -- you're talking about a much longer-term situation.\\nWHITFIELD: And then, Douglas, you know, just listening to the ceremony and listening to the -- whether it be the poet or even Secretary Kerry, some beautiful, you know, words that were being used. And when using language like, you know, as two peoples who are no longer enemies or rivals, but neighbors playing the Cuban national anthem first, and then later playing, you know, the U.S. national anthem. In what way do you see those as, you know, significant moves in order to really kind of thaw the ice?\\nBRINKLEY: Well, I think the Cuban people and the American people have a shared rich history. And so one of the ways that the ice thawing is going to happen are cultural exchanges. Students going down to Cuba now. People going to do tourism. I went down to Cuba just to see the sight of the Bay of Pigs invasion. And went to see where Theodore Roosevelt's, you know, history down there. It's an amazing place, Havana. So I think the influx of American tourists going to Cuba is going to be quite remarkable. And when people start talking and dialoguing, sharing music, food, it's a chance for these two countries to get much closer. And also Fidel Castro is on his last legs, so to speak. And Raul Castro has shown more of an -- shown signs that he liked to get along with the United States. So for some people that remember the Cuban missile crisis, this is really a moment to celebrate when tensions are at an all-time low right now.\\nWHITFIELD: Yes, neither of the Castros were there, but, you know, their aura, indeed.\\nWHITFIELD: You know, is certainly in the vicinity.\\nBRINKLEY: Yes.\\nWHITFIELD: Stephen Schlesinger and Douglas Brinkley, thanks to both of you. Appreciate it.\\nBRINKLEY: Thanks.\\nSCHLESINGER: Thank you.\\nWHITFIELD: All right. We'll be right back.\""

    "source": "JOHN KING, CNN HOST, \"INSIDE POLITICS\": OK, it's an issue and it may be an issue in California, but for Jeb Bush to be stuck in the quick sand. I am convinced anchor baby could become the self- support of 2016. Once Mitt Romney went there in the campaign four years ago, it was over with Latino voters.\nASHLEY PARKER, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": Right, I mean, it certainly was and here's the thing, Jeb Bush is a self-described policy wonk and a self-described nerd ball and so he wants to be talking about the policy and Trump has clearly gotten Jeb Bush and all the other Republicans off their game, and of course, this was some sort of make this about language and rhetoric. And when you're trying to substitute one group -- with another group, he is now offended, you're simply not winning regardless if you have very good policy that a lot of immigration activists agree with as Jeb does.\nKING: I think Mr. Trump is under the governor's skin, fair to say?\nROBERT COSTA, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": He is. I spoke to Trump yesterday. He just continues to slam Bush. And he loves it. I said are you going to stop it ever? He said, probably not and on immigration especially this has put the Republican Party in a tough position. The base loves what Trump is saying on immigration. Whether it plays in a general election, who knows?\nKING: Right, but the calendar has been changed, those southern states are going to be a lot more important this time.\nCOSTA: Even if you don't get a big bounce out of those early February caucuses and primaries, March 1st, nine states, south.\nKING: You mentioned he says he may not stop going after Governor Bush, someone needs to help me understand why he thinks it's in his benefit, to his benefit to keep going after Megyn Kelly. Megyn Kelly was on vacation. Donald Trump tweeting out last night at Megyn Kelly, \"Must have had a terrible vacation. She is really off her game. Was afraid to confront Dr. Cornel West. No clue on immigration.\" That was about the \"Kelly File\" last night. Later he tweets, \"I like the \"Kelly File\" much better without Megyn Kelly. Maybe she could take another 11-day unscheduled vacation\" so two sort of gratuitous shots at her there. What I think is a bigger problem. He then again re-tweeted a tweet where somebody called her a bimbo. He did that right after the Fox debate when he had the confrontation with her and he does it again last night. No rules apply to Donald Trump, but I cannot see how that is in his interest.\nPARKET: I was very stunned to see those tweets as well. Donald Trump is in a weird way a post Fox News candidate, a post everything candidate. The rules of traditional politics do not apply. You cannot go to war with Fox News. You try to get booked on all of their shows, right? And he's doing the exact opposite and crowd loves him for it.\nCOSTA: I was at a focus group last night of Trump supporters in Virginia and the one thing -- these were all Trump supporters, the one thing that really turned them off, Trump's comments about women. He should be paying attention to the voters. It's not acceptable if you're a presidential candidate.\nKING: Interesting point. We'll see how this plays out. Betsy Klein sent out a note saying she was talking to a Trump supporter who said, as a parent, it makes me cringe, some of the stuff he puts out on Twitter. Ashley, Robert, thanks for coming in.

        "\"JOHN KING, CNN HOST, \\\"INSIDE POLITICS\\\": OK, it's an issue and it may be an issue in California, but for Jeb Bush to be stuck in the quick sand. I am convinced anchor baby could become the self- support of 2016. Once Mitt Romney went there in the campaign four years ago, it was over with Latino voters.\\nASHLEY PARKER, \\\"THE NEW YORK TIMES\\\": Right, I mean, it certainly was and here's the thing, Jeb Bush is a self-described policy wonk and a self-described nerd ball and so he wants to be talking about the policy and Trump has clearly gotten Jeb Bush and all the other Republicans off their game, and of course, this was some sort of make this about language and rhetoric. And when you're trying to substitute one group -- with another group, he is now offended, you're simply not winning regardless if you have very good policy that a lot of immigration activists agree with as Jeb does.\\nKING: I think Mr. Trump is under the governor's skin, fair to say?\\nROBERT COSTA, \\\"THE WASHINGTON POST\\\": He is. I spoke to Trump yesterday. He just continues to slam Bush. And he loves it. I said are you going to stop it ever? He said, probably not and on immigration especially this has put the Republican Party in a tough position. The base loves what Trump is saying on immigration. Whether it plays in a general election, who knows?\\nKING: Right, but the calendar has been changed, those southern states are going to be a lot more important this time.\\nCOSTA: Even if you don't get a big bounce out of those early February caucuses and primaries, March 1st, nine states, south.\\nKING: You mentioned he says he may not stop going after Governor Bush, someone needs to help me understand why he thinks it's in his benefit, to his benefit to keep going after Megyn Kelly. Megyn Kelly was on vacation. Donald Trump tweeting out last night at Megyn Kelly, \\\"Must have had a terrible vacation. She is really off her game. Was afraid to confront Dr. Cornel West. No clue on immigration.\\\" That was about the \\\"Kelly File\\\" last night. Later he tweets, \\\"I like the \\\"Kelly File\\\" much better without Megyn Kelly. Maybe she could take another 11-day unscheduled vacation\\\" so two sort of gratuitous shots at her there. What I think is a bigger problem. He then again re-tweeted a tweet where somebody called her a bimbo. He did that right after the Fox debate when he had the confrontation with her and he does it again last night. No rules apply to Donald Trump, but I cannot see how that is in his interest.\\nPARKET: I was very stunned to see those tweets as well. Donald Trump is in a weird way a post Fox News candidate, a post everything candidate. The rules of traditional politics do not apply. You cannot go to war with Fox News. You try to get booked on all of their shows, right? And he's doing the exact opposite and crowd loves him for it.\\nCOSTA: I was at a focus group last night of Trump supporters in Virginia and the one thing -- these were all Trump supporters, the one thing that really turned them off, Trump's comments about women. He should be paying attention to the voters. It's not acceptable if you're a presidential candidate.\\nKING: Interesting point. We'll see how this plays out. Betsy Klein sent out a note saying she was talking to a Trump supporter who said, as a parent, it makes me cringe, some of the stuff he puts out on Twitter. Ashley, Robert, thanks for coming in.

Everything is happy. We are having a good time. He is going back to the wilderness. He goes -- oh, wait, no.\nPINSKY: He is fast.\nGONZAGA: Yes. He is on his way home back to where he is supposed to live and then they shoot him.\nPINSKY: No.\nGONZAGA: There they go. They shoot him.\nCATHERWOOD: You knew they would do that. It is Russia.\nGONZAGA: They could have just shot him with, you know, stunt pellets.\nPINSKY: It is a good thing Sam Schacher is not here. She would be sobbing.\nGONZAGA: It is very sad. You know, everyone loves a good bear to the mall video, but not good when it ends up dead. It is Russia!\nPINSKY: Great Russian bear.\nCATHERWOOD: You knew that was coming.

    "source": "BLITZER: We continue watching as a climber makes his way up the outside of Trump Tower in New York City. Stay on top of this story, update you with more. But we're also following some other new developments in the presidential race. Hillary Clinton this afternoon slammed what she called Donald Trump's casual inciting of violence saying his remarks about Second Amendment people crossed the line. But Trump is on the attack as well today. He says newly disclosed e-mails reveal what Trump calls a pay-for-play scheme involving the Clinton Foundation and the State Department. The campaign strongly denies any wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton. Let's bring in our senior Washington correspondent Jeff Zeleny. He's got more on the -- on this e-mail story that has surfaced. What is the latest, Jeff?\nJEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, the Clinton campaign is denying that there was any impropriety between the secretary of state and any of these friends and donors. But this latest group of e-mail really shines the light on how closely connected all of the contributors and old friends of the Clintons' actually were with the State Department. And, Wolf, frankly it's the last thing that the campaign wants to be talking about now. They prefer to keep the focus on Donald Trump.\nZELENY (voice-over): Old e-mails causing new trouble tonight for Hillary Clinton. As she campaigns in Iowa, a new batch of messages from her time as secretary of state is raising fresh questions about the influence and access donors to the Clinton family's charitable foundation had on the State Department. The e-mails released Tuesday after conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch filed suit. It's adding new fuel to a controversy hanging over her campaign.\nCLINTON: I know people have raised questions about my e-mail use as secretary of state. And I understand why.\nZELENY: In one exchange, a long time aide to President Clinton, Doug Band, lobbied Secretary Clinton's aides to find a job at the State Department for someone who was important to take care of. The name of the person Band is trying to help is redacted. He made the request to Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, two top Hillary Clinton aides who remain among her closest advisers. Abedin reassures Band personnel has been sending him options. There is no indication he was a donor. It's the latest chapter in a long saga over the Clinton Foundation and her e-mails particularly her decision to use a private server as secretary of state. The FBI did not file charges but it's taken a toll on her credibility.\nCLINTON: And I want to be as transparent as possible.\nZELENY: In another e-mail, Band tries to connect a Clinton Foundation donor, a Lebanese Nigerian billionaire, with the State Department's substance person on Lebanon. \"As you know, he's a key guy there and to us is loved in Lebanon. Very important,\" Band wrote. Donald Trump is seizing on the disclosure calling it an example of a cozy and corrupt relationship between Clinton donors and the State Department.\nTRUMP: It's called pay-for-play. And some of these were really, really bad and illegal.\nZELENY: A Clinton campaign spokesman brushed aside the criticism, saying, \"Hillary Clinton never took action as secretary of state because of donations to the Clinton Foundation.\" Campaigning in Iowa today, Clinton kept her focus on Trump.\nCLINTON: Yesterday we witnessed the latest in a long line of casual comments from Donald Trump that crossed the line.\nZELENY: Her campaign is raising money from his incendiary comments Tuesday, asking supporters to have her back.\nTRUMP: If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is. I don't know.\nZELENY: Trump's rhetoric is turning more Republicans against him. The Clinton campaign unveiling a new list of GOP supporters, including former Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez, former director of the National Intelligence John Negroponte, and former Connecticut congressman Chris Shays.\nCHRISTOPHER SHAYS (R), FORMER CONNECTICUT REPRESENTATIVE: I'm going to vote for Hillary. I didn't -- I didn't imagine that, but it's -- frankly it's become an easy decision. Trump lost me months ago.\nZELENY: Now Hillary Clinton is doing extensive outreach to Republicans, including, Wolf, writing an op-ed in the Salt Lake City newspaper, reaching out to Mormon voters there, talking about religious freedom, and how Donald Trump simply isn't acceptable. And, Wolf, she's headed to Michigan tonight. She'll be giving an economic address tomorrow. Right in Mitt Romney's old backyard. Those Reagan Democrats she's after. The Clinton campaign clearly wants to put this e-mail controversy aside and focus back on the economy where she's leading Donald Trump in most polls.\nBLITZER: Jeff Zeleny, reporting, thanks very much. We'll continue to monitor this climber going up Trump Tower. Much more on that. All the day's important news right after this.",

    "source": "BLITZER: This just coming in to CNN. The actress, Margot Kidder, has died. She had been a staple on movies and television since breaking into the business as a 20-year-old in 1968. She's best known playing Lois Lane in all four of the Christopher Reeve \"Superman\" films.\nMARGOT KIDDER, ACTRESS: Do you have a girlfriend?\nCHRISTOPHER REEVE, ACTOR: No, I don't. But if I did, you would be the first to know about it.\nKIDDER: Um.\nBLITZER: Her family says she passed away quietly in her home in Montana. Margot kidder was 69 years old. Other news we're following, dozens of Palestinians were killed today during protests in Gaza along the border with Israel. The demonstrations were aimed at the United States' opening a new embassy in Jerusalem, moving the new embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations says today's violence means there's no chance at peace. Let's get perspective from the Palestinians right now. Joining us, Ambassador Husam Zomlot. He's the head of the Palestinian authorities' delegation to the United States. Mr. Ambassador, thank you very much for joining us. Give us immediate reaction, if you can, to what the latest developments are, the impact of the U.S. moving the embassy, and what it means for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process?\nAMB. HUSAM ZOMLOT, DIRECTOR, PLO DELEGRATION TO THE UNITED STATES: Just the U.S. administration has gave up on the peace process and its role as a mediator international towards achieving the internationally endorsed two-state solution. And it also means the U.S. has gave in for the voices of extremism, for the voices we'll see a zero-sum game, the fanatics, politically speaking. It was telling today that the ones who opened the ceremony of moving the U.S. embassy are religious leaders of the Christian Zionists who interpret politics and legality and world map from a very contested, to say the least, religious implications. This is not only encouraging Israel to cross the line. It's very encouraging to Israel to cross the line towards Armageddon and the end-of-time prophecy.\nBLITZER: Ambassador, are you at all, Mr. Ambassador, in touch with Trump administration officials? They keep saying they're about to release their peace plan, Israeli-Palestinian peace plan, and they still have hope for the two-state solution, Israel alongside a new state of Palestine. Have you had conversations with these American officials?\nZOMLOT: We don't know what they're talking about, really. We don't know. Peace is a very firm vision by the U.S. That vision has been drawn by all previous administrations, with the 1968 borders, establishing a sovereign state with each in the U.S. capital. The U.S. law is very clear. It was presented in 1991 by former administrator, James Baker. It is very clear. The U.S. intervention and vision is about Israel's occupation, implementing U.N. Security Council resolutions and respecting them in Jerusalem, never recognizing Israel's control of annexations. So what the U.S. administration has done is reneging on these promises and violating international law. There is a U.N. Security Council resolution that the U.S. voted for and that presents any state from moving its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. And also the U.S. has stated that Jerusalem is outside the negotiating table. You know it, Wolf, very well. You have been there for many decades. But Jerusalem is the heart of the two states solution --\nBLITZER: Let me just interrupt, Ambassador, because they say they're not necessarily concluding all final status of all parts of Jerusalem. Yes, the U.S. is moving the embassy to west Jerusalem, but they're not completely ruling out the possibility of the Palestinians having control of parts of east Jerusalem and having a U.S. embassy in east Jerusalem for the new Palestinian state. When you hear that from the administration, what do you think?\nZOMLOT: No, I only have it from you now. Jerusalem is the capital of the Jewish people. It's not even the capital of Israel. As I said earlier, a clear religious interpretation of international relations and legal matters on one hand. On the other hand, there was a reason why all previous American presidents, from President Truman to President Obama, why they decided not to move the embassy. They knew, by doing so, you actually remove the U.S. from the role of the mediator and dictate the terms of reference and dictate the outcome of Jerusalem being an issue. Of course, we would be fine if the U.S. has -- when there are two embassies after reaching a peace agreement. Before that, it is -- it will only be seen as urgent on the Palestinians. President Trump himself says removing the Jerusalem from the table, taking it off the table. And then they wanted to remove the administration off the table that services the refugees. And then they are not even criticizing or condemning the illegal settlement expansion, which has been the major obstacle on the part of the two-state solution. And they are not even criticizing or condemning the murder by Israeli forces of the Palestinian peaceful demonstrators. So the bottom line, what peace process this administration is talking about? We believe that peace --\nZOMLOT: -- can be found now in the international community, in a multilateral forum. Peace can only be found based on legality, based on politics, not based on ideology, and some very twisted religious interpretations of reality.\nBLITZER: Ambassador Zomlot, let's see what this -- if they do release a plan, the Trump administration, what specifically it spells out. We'll continue our conversations. Ambassador Zomlot, thanks so much for joining us.\nZOMLOT: Thank you.\nBLITZER: We're going to hear from the White House about these deadly protests in Gaza, along the border with Israel in a few minutes. I'm sure there will be plenty of questions on that, plenty of questions on a lot of other issues as well. The White House press briefing set to begin at the top of the hour. We'll have live coverage. We'll be right back.",

And it also means the U.S. has gave in for the voices of extremism, for the voices we'll see a zero-sum game, the fanatics, politically speaking. It was telling today that the ones who opened the ceremony of moving the U.S. embassy are religious leaders of the Christian Zionists who interpret politics and legality and world map from a very contested, to say the least, religious implications. This is not only encouraging Israel to cross the line. It's very encouraging to Israel to cross the line towards Armageddon and the end-of-time prophecy.\\nBLITZER: Ambassador, are you at all, Mr. Ambassador, in touch with Trump administration officials? They keep saying they're about to release their peace plan, Israeli-Palestinian peace plan, and they still have hope for the two-state solution, Israel alongside a new state of Palestine. Have you had conversations with these American officials?\\nZOMLOT: We don't know what they're talking about, really. We don't know. Peace is a very firm vision by the U.S. That vision has been drawn by all previous administrations, with the 1968 borders, establishing a sovereign state with each in the U.S. capital. The U.S. law is very clear. It was presented in 1991 by former administrator, James Baker. It is very clear. The U.S. intervention and vision is about Israel's occupation, implementing U.N. Security Council resolutions and respecting them in Jerusalem, never recognizing Israel's control of annexations. So what the U.S. administration has done is reneging on these promises and violating international law. There is a U.N. Security Council resolution that the U.S. voted for and that presents any state from moving its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. And also the U.S. has stated that Jerusalem is outside the negotiating table. You know it, Wolf, very well. You have been there for many decades. But Jerusalem is the heart of the two states solution --\\nBLITZER: Let me just interrupt, Ambassador, because they say they're not necessarily concluding all final status of all parts of Jerusalem. Yes, the U.S. is moving the embassy to west Jerusalem, but they're not completely ruling out the possibility of the Palestinians having control of parts of east Jerusalem and having a U.S. embassy in east Jerusalem for the new Palestinian state. When you hear that from the administration, what do you think?\\nZOMLOT: No, I only have it from you now. Jerusalem is the capital of the Jewish people. It's not even the capital of Israel. As I said earlier, a clear religious interpretation of international relations and legal matters on one hand. On the other hand, there was a reason why all previous American presidents, from President Truman to President Obama, why they decided not to move the embassy. They knew, by doing so, you actually remove the U.S. from the role of the mediator and dictate the terms of reference and dictate the outcome of Jerusalem being an issue. Of course, we would be fine if the U.S. has -- when there are two embassies after reaching a peace agreement. Before that, it is -- it will only be seen as urgent on the Palestinians. President Trump himself says removing the Jerusalem from the table, taking it off the table. And then they wanted to remove the administration off the table that services the refugees. And then they are not even criticizing or condemning the illegal settlement expansion, which has been the major obstacle on the part of the two-state solution. And they are not even criticizing or condemning the murder by Israeli forces of the Palestinian peaceful demonstrators. So the bottom line, what peace process this administration is talking about? We believe that peace --\\nZOMLOT: -- can be found now in the international community, in a multilateral forum. Peace can only be found based on legality, based on politics, not based on ideology, and some very twisted religious interpretations of reality.\\nBLITZER: Ambassador Zomlot, let's see what this -- if they do release a plan, the Trump administration, what specifically it spells out. We'll continue our conversations. Ambassador Zomlot, thanks so much for joining us.\\nZOMLOT: Thank you.\\nBLITZER: We're going to hear from the White House about these deadly protests in Gaza, along the border with Israel in a few minutes. I'm sure there will be plenty of questions on that, plenty of questions on a lot of other issues as well. The White House press briefing set to begin at the top of the hour. We'll have live coverage.

    "topic": "Argentina's World Cup performance",
    "source": "GORANI: A major shocker at the World Cup right now. Just minutes ago, Argentina lost to Croatia three nail. That would make it extremely difficult for Argentina to advance out of their group. On the pitch today, France beat Peru, one nail. Yay. Which moves them into the knockout stage of the World Cup. Russia and Uruguay, so far, are the only other teams to advance. Russia's success certainly is a surprise. They came into the cup as the lowest rated team in the tournament. They have something called a home advantage though, I think Fred Pleitgen has been following the Russian national team and he's in Moscow. Fred.\nFREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hala, we visited their training camp earlier today and what we saw there was a very confident team, obviously bolstered by those two win that they got and a team that believes that they could do great things at the World Cup. And so now does this nation. Here's what we saw.\nPLEITGEN: It's not often that you see Russians this emotional. But the country's been in a football frenzy ever since the World Cup started. Thanks to Russia's Cinderella squad, a team most experts thought would fail miserably, but has outscored its opponents Eight to one so far. Defender Andrei Semyonov told me the team always believed in itself. Nobody believed in us, he says, now everyone does and they're starting to put medals on us. But we don't look at it. We studied our opponents really well and predicted everything. But few observers could have predicted their success. Russia is the lowest ranked team at the World Cup. Wouldn't have even qualified if they weren't the host nation. And many feared the mood at the World Cup would sour and the home team performed poorly. Now, the squad, led by striker Artem Dzyuba is on a roll. Team Russia has already proved all of its critics wrong, well, in all of its matches and already qualifying for the next round. And now both this nation and this team believe they can do great things at the FIFA 2018 World Cup. And with a successful squad, Russians are embracing their nation's role as hosts of the tournament. Striker Fyodor Kudryashov telling me, home field advantage has also helped elevate the team's performance. The fans are the 12th player on the field for us, he said. We feel their overwhelming support and our team goes forward. If there is a knock on the Russians, it's that they haven't played any of the really strong teams so far. But for now, Russia is enjoying the winning streak, hoping their World Cup fairy tale doesn't end any time soon.\nPLEITGEN: And, Hala, of course the next game they have will be against the stronger team, it's against Uruguay. And after that, of course, we get to the knockout stages and it's really going to be there that the Russians are going to show whether they are for real or not, Hala.\nGORANI: Yes, we will be watching. Thanks, Fred. For Shakespeare, it was the sonnet, for Rembrandt and Picasso, a masterpiece painted in oils. But in this day and age, there seems to be only one way to truly honor the special moments in our life.\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Let me take a selfie. The Chainsmokers there capturing the very essence of social media's magnum opus, the selfie. A photographic custom being honored today on National Selfie Day. Selfie is a relatively new term. But did you know the first selfie was taken in 1839 by photographer Robert Cornelius in Philadelphia? Truly a visionary, so who we were to resist the tide of history? This is our HALA GORANI TONIGHT team in London. That's a selfie. One of these team has a super long arm. We reached out to our colleagues at CNN center in the U.S., but unfortunately, they were all having bad hair days. So instead, and keeping with another great internet tradition, here's a picture of a selfie taking cat, and his name is Manny. Manny takes these photos with a GoPro cam, and he's seen here with a close friend. New Zealand's prime minister has given birth, becoming only the second female world leader to do so while in office. Jacinda Ardern and her partner Clarke Gayford posted this snap with their newborn daughter earlier. Is it a selfie? Looks like it could be, actually. She will now take six weeks maternity leave and has handed over her responsibilities to the deputy prime minister, who is now serving as acting prime minister. She follows in the footsteps of the former Pakistani Prime Minister, Benazir Bhutto, who had a child while in office in 1990. Thanks for watching tonight, everyone. I'm Hala Gorani.

        "\"GORANI: A major shocker at the World Cup right now. Just minutes ago, Argentina lost to Croatia three nail. That would make it extremely difficult for Argentina to advance out of their group. On the pitch today, France beat Peru, one nail. Yay. Which moves them into the knockout stage of the World Cup. Russia and Uruguay, so far, are the only other teams to advance. Russia's success certainly is a surprise. They came into the cup as the lowest rated team in the tournament.

Fred.\\nFREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hala, we visited their training camp earlier today and what we saw there was a very confident team, obviously bolstered by those two win that they got and a team that believes that they could do great things at the World Cup. And so now does this nation. Here's what we saw.\\nPLEITGEN: It's not often that you see Russians this emotional. But the country's been in a football frenzy ever since the World Cup started. Thanks to Russia's Cinderella squad, a team most experts thought would fail miserably, but has outscored its opponents Eight to one so far. Defender Andrei Semyonov told me the team always believed in itself. Nobody believed in us, he says, now everyone does and they're starting to put medals on us. But we don't look at it. We studied our opponents really well and predicted everything. But few observers could have predicted their success. Russia is the lowest ranked team at the World Cup. Wouldn't have even qualified if they weren't the host nation. And many feared the mood at the World Cup would sour and the home team performed poorly. Now, the squad, led by striker Artem Dzyuba is on a roll. Team Russia has already proved all of its critics wrong, well, in all of its matches and already qualifying for the next round.

    "source": "COLLEEN MCEDWARDS, CNN ANCHOR: The Olympics have a new boss. The International Olympic Committee has elected Jacques Rogge of Belgium to an eight-year term, replacing Juan Antonio Samaranch, of Spain. The two met with reporters in Moscow, including our Patrick Snell, who's there.\nPATRICK SNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Colleen, that's right: the Samaranch era has officially come to an end after 21 years. Now all eyes will be focusing on the 59-year old orthopedic surgeon from Belgium, Jacques Rogge. Out of all the candidates, in terms of sporting politics, he was perhaps the man with the least experience -- but his very, very widespread reputation is of being a smooth diplomat; an IOC problem solver, if you like; and a man widely credited with organizing the phenomenally successful Sydney, Australia, Games last year. Rogge has a great sporting background himself. He competed in the '68, '72, and '76 Olympic Games, as a sailor, and also played rugby for his country, and is today happy to share center stage with the outgoing president, Juan Antonio Samaranch -- and a really lovely touch when he presented Samaranch himself with an Olympic Gold Medal for his own achievements. Absolutely typical of the man -- smooth talking -- and a very, very popular decision. Now a word about the rivals he beat. Rogge in the second round of voting, he won. He totaled 59 votes. That was well clear of his closest rival, the South Korean politician Un-yong Kim, who got 23 votes. That's one clear of the Canadian lawyer, Dick Pound. So the new IOC president, the Belgian Jacques Rogge -- Colleen.\nMCEDWARDS: All right, thanks very much, Patrick.\nBRIAN NELSON, CNN ANCHOR: And our next guest is Melinda McKay. She's the senior vice president of a company called Jones Lang LaSalle. This is a firm that did an Olympic study on the long-term impact that cities who've received the Olympic Games are able to benefit from. And they've gone back and studied Sydney, Atlanta, Barcelona, and Seoul. So we now introduce Melinda McKay. Let's talk about Beijing. First of all, thank you for being with us, Ms. McKay. Why the study and who paid for it -- very quickly.\nMELINDA MCKAY, JONES LANG LASALLE: The study was done based on the fact that I was actually in Sydney last year, and I was seeing firsthand what was happening in the markets, the sort of infrastructure developments that were occurring and I thought it would be very interesting for our clients to actually take a look at what happened in past host cities and see if there were any consistencies across that.\nNELSON: Summarize what you found.\nMCKAY: We found that although there are certainly short-term economic gains to be had from the Olympics -- between $3 billion and $17 billion, depending on which of the past four host cities you look at. But really, the long-term legacy is in the change to the urban form of the city. At least the past four Olympic host cities have really used the Games to revitalize rundown urban areas.\nNELSON: All right and what would be the biggest example you'd like to point to?\nMCKAY: I would take the Sydney experience, because as I said before, I was seeing it first hand. They essentially turned the Olympic Village from a munitions dump -- it was an unusable industrial front -- into the world's most environmentally friendly suburb. And if you take the Atlanta example, they spent $1 billion on capital works as a result of the Games and have revitalized the downtown area.\nNELSON: In Atlanta, there was a change, in a sense, to the infrastructure around the Centennial Park, which was created to honor the Olympics. But by and large, some people may question whether all of this was worth the millions and millions -- or maybe I should say billions of dollars -- that are poured into getting the Olympic Games. Does it really balance out?\nMCKAY: I really do think it does, if you just take a pure look at the net economic gain that is measured from the Olympic Games -- and it, as I said before, ranges between $3 billion and $17 billion, and that's just the short-term gain; you've got the long-term changes to the urban form, which are just tremendous.\nNELSON: For residents of Beijing, if the city goes ahead and keeps its promises, what should residents be seeing by the year 2008 to their city?\nMCKAY: The Beijing of 2008 will definitely be significantly different from the city that we see now. Beijing is spending $12.2 billion on environmental improvements and antipollution measures. They're spending $3.7 billion on transport infrastructure. They are turning their Olympic Village -- the Olympic Green -- into a 200-acre park, and they're surrounding that by a nature park as well.

        "\"COLLEEN MCEDWARDS, CNN ANCHOR: The Olympics have a new boss. The International Olympic Committee has elected Jacques Rogge of Belgium to an eight-year term, replacing Juan Antonio Samaranch, of Spain. The two met with reporters in Moscow, including our Patrick Snell, who's there.\\nPATRICK SNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Colleen, that's right: the Samaranch era has officially come to an end after 21 years. Now all eyes will be focusing on the 59-year old orthopedic surgeon from Belgium, Jacques Rogge. Out of all the candidates, in terms of sporting politics, he was perhaps the man with the least experience -- but his very, very widespread reputation is of being a smooth diplomat; an IOC problem solver, if you like; and a man widely credited with organizing the phenomenally successful Sydney, Australia, Games last year. Rogge has a great sporting background himself. He competed in the '68, '72, and '76 Olympic Games, as a sailor, and also played rugby for his country, and is today happy to share center stage with the outgoing president, Juan Antonio Samaranch -- and a really lovely touch when he presented Samaranch himself with an Olympic Gold Medal for his own achievements. Absolutely typical of the man -- smooth talking -- and a very, very popular decision. Now a word about the rivals he beat. Rogge in the second round of voting, he won. He totaled 59 votes. That was well clear of his closest rival, the South Korean politician Un-yong Kim, who got 23 votes. That's one clear of the Canadian lawyer, Dick Pound. So the new IOC president, the Belgian Jacques Rogge -- Colleen.\\nMCEDWARDS: All right, thanks very much, Patrick.\\nBRIAN NELSON, CNN ANCHOR: And our next guest is Melinda McKay. She's the senior vice president of a company called Jones Lang LaSalle. This is a firm that did an Olympic study on the long-term impact that cities who've received the Olympic Games are able to benefit from. And they've gone back and studied Sydney, Atlanta, Barcelona, and Seoul. So we now introduce Melinda McKay. Let's talk about Beijing. First of all, thank you for being with us, Ms. McKay. Why the study and who paid for it -- very quickly.\\nMELINDA MCKAY, JONES LANG LASALLE: The study was done based on the fact that I was actually in Sydney last year, and I was seeing firsthand what was happening in the markets, the sort of infrastructure developments that were occurring and I thought it would be very interesting for our clients to actually take a look at what happened in past host cities and see if there were any consistencies across that.\\nNELSON: Summarize what you found.\\nMCKAY: We found that although there are certainly short-term economic gains to be had from the Olympics -- between $3 billion and $17 billion, depending on which of the past four host cities you look at. But really, the long-term legacy is in the change to the urban form of the city. At least the past four Olympic host cities have really used the Games to revitalize rundown urban areas.\\nNELSON: All right and what would be the biggest example you'd like to point to?\\nMCKAY: I would take the Sydney experience, because as I said before, I was seeing it first hand. They essentially turned the Olympic Village from a munitions dump -- it was an unusable industrial front -- into the world's most environmentally friendly suburb. And if you take the Atlanta example, they spent $1 billion on capital works as a result of the Games and have revitalized the downtown area.\\nNELSON: In Atlanta, there was a change, in a sense, to the infrastructure around the Centennial Park, which was created to honor the Olympics. But by and large, some people may question whether all of this was worth the millions and millions -- or maybe I should say billions of dollars -- that are poured into getting the Olympic Games. Does it really balance out?\\nMCKAY: I really do think it does, if you just take a pure look at the net economic gain that is measured from the Olympic Games -- and it, as I said before, ranges between $3 billion and $17 billion, and that's just the short-term gain; you've got the long-term changes to the urban form, which are just tremendous.\\nNELSON: For residents of Beijing, if the city goes ahead and keeps its promises, what should residents be seeing by the year 2008 to their city?\\nMCKAY: The Beijing of 2008 will definitely be significantly different from the city that we see now. Beijing is spending $12.2 billion on environmental improvements and antipollution measures. They're spending $3.7 billion on transport infrastructure.

    "topic": "Lady Gaga's apology and decision to remove music featuring R. Kelly",
    "source": "KEILAR: Another big star is speaking out against singer, R. Kelly, amid explosive claims in which he's accused of being a sexual predator who abused multiple young women. Lady Gaga has apologized for working with the star and she's pulled all of her music that features R. Kelly from streaming platforms. Kelly and Gaga made a duet that was called, \"Do What You Want with My Body.\" And they even performed it here on \"Saturday Night Live\" together. But in a statement, Lady Gaga posted on Twitter, she explains this, in part, \"What I am hearing about the allegations against R. Kelly is absolutely horrifying and indefensible. As a victim of sexual assault myself, I made both the song and video in a dark time in my life. I intend to remove this song off of iTunes and other streaming platforms and will not be working with him again.\" \"Rolling Stone\" reports that at least two Dallas radio stations have banned his music from their air waves. Meanwhile, R. Kelly was spotted and videotaped last night inside a Chicago nightclub with a message for a crowd.\nR. KELLY, SINGER: There's something that I must confess you all\nKEILAR: While Kelly was in that club, there were several protesters rallying outside his Chicago studios chanting, \"Mute R. Kelly.\" Joining me to discuss, we have Lola Ogunnaike, the anchor for \"People TV.\" Lola, as you watch all of this, do you think this is the beginning of the end for R. Kelly?\nLOLA OGUNNAIKE, ANCHOR, PEOPLE TV: Brianna, you and I were talking off-camera, I was here 17 years ago on CNN talking about a story that I'd written for the cover of \"Vibe\" magazine. It was a 6,000-word expose. I do finally feel like justice will prevail like this time of around. It's taken a number of years, well over a decade but justice will finally prevail.\nKEILAR: So this is something -- it's been on your radar for the better part of two decades. You have artists saying, I am not going to be associated with this guy. There were things that were known. What has changed?\nOGUNNAIKE: I think the world at large has changed. The \"Me Too\" movement has been very instrumental in helping people redefine the way they look at relationships between men and women, men and men, inappropriate relationships in general. I think people are willing to have a conversation that they weren't willing to have as early as a year ago. The \"Me Too\" movement has been extremely instrumental in helping us have a very important conversation that had been ignored and swept under the rug for the better part of two decades.\nOGUNNAIKE: I want to talk about Lady Gaga. Interestingly enough, Lady Gaga's apology went a long way, but she had a glaring omission in that apology. There was a video that was supposed to accompany this song and it was a video that was shot by famed fashion photographer, Terry Richardson. She had also been accused for more than a decade of being a sexual predator. He was accused of preying upon young girls. \"Vogue\" banned him from shooting in his magazine. She worked with not one, but two sexual predators on this project. It was problematic then. She knew it. I find it interesting that now she's coming forward with her apology.\nKEILAR: What did you think of R. Kelly on just how defiant he has been, that he shows up at this club and he is singing his heart out with some support there, obviously?\nOGUNNAIKE: R. Kelly is doing what he's always done. R. Kelly in the past has always been able to get away with this behavior because he was always able to produce a hit and sing away his problems. He's at the tail end of his career. People had been muting R. Kelly for years. He's no longer at the height of his career and I do think people are now saying, I don't care what music he creates, I don't care if he's a musical genius, he has a serious problem with young women and it has to stop.\nKEILAR: Lola, thank you so much. Lola Ogunnaike, we appreciate you being with us.\nOGUNNAIKE: Thank you.\nKEILAR: I'm Brianna Keilar, live in Washington. And tomorrow, 800,000 federal workers won't get paid. Many are protesting today.",

        "\"KEILAR: Another big star is speaking out against singer, R. Kelly, amid explosive claims in which he's accused of being a sexual predator who abused multiple young women. Lady Gaga has apologized for working with the star and she's pulled all of her music that features R. Kelly from streaming platforms. Kelly and Gaga made a duet that was called, \\\"Do What You Want with My Body.\\\" And they even performed it here on \\\"Saturday Night Live\\\" together. But in a statement, Lady Gaga posted on Twitter, she explains this, in part, \\\"What I am hearing about the allegations against R. Kelly is absolutely horrifying and indefensible. As a victim of sexual assault myself, I made both the song and video in a dark time in my life. I intend to remove this song off of iTunes and other streaming platforms and will not be working with him again.\\\" \\\"Rolling Stone\\\" reports that at least two Dallas radio stations have banned his music from their air waves. Meanwhile, R. Kelly was spotted and videotaped last night inside a Chicago nightclub with a message for a crowd.\\nR. KELLY, SINGER: There's something that I must confess you all\\nKEILAR: While Kelly was in that club, there were several protesters rallying outside his Chicago studios chanting, \\\"Mute R. Kelly.\\\" Joining me to discuss, we have Lola Ogunnaike, the anchor for \\\"People TV.\\\" Lola, as you watch all of this, do you think this is the beginning of the end for R. Kelly?\\nLOLA OGUNNAIKE, ANCHOR, PEOPLE TV: Brianna, you and I were talking off-camera, I was here 17 years ago on CNN talking about a story that I'd written for the cover of \\\"Vibe\\\" magazine. It was a 6,000-word expose. I do finally feel like justice will prevail like this time of around. It's taken a number of years, well over a decade but justice will finally prevail.\\nKEILAR: So this is something -- it's been on your radar for the better part of two decades. You have artists saying, I am not going to be associated with this guy. There were things that were known. What has changed?\\nOGUNNAIKE: I think the world at large has changed. The \\\"Me Too\\\" movement has been very instrumental in helping people redefine the way they look at relationships between men and women, men and men, inappropriate relationships in general. I think people are willing to have a conversation that they weren't willing to have as early as a year ago. The \\\"Me Too\\\" movement has been extremely instrumental in helping us have a very important conversation that had been ignored and swept under the rug for the better part of two decades.\\nOGUNNAIKE: I want to talk about Lady Gaga. Interestingly enough, Lady Gaga's apology went a long way, but she had a glaring omission in that apology. There was a video that was supposed to accompany this song and it was a video that was shot by famed fashion photographer, Terry Richardson. She had also been accused for more than a decade of being a sexual predator. He was accused of preying upon young girls. \\\"Vogue\\\" banned him from shooting in his magazine. She worked with not one, but two sexual predators on this project. It was problematic then. She knew it. I find it interesting that now she's coming forward with her apology.\\nKEILAR: What did you think of R. Kelly on just how defiant he has been, that he shows up at this club and he is singing his heart out with some support there, obviously?\\nOGUNNAIKE: R. Kelly is doing what he's always done. R. Kelly in the past has always been able to get away with this behavior because he was always able to produce a hit and sing away his problems. He's at the tail end of his career. People had been muting R. Kelly for years. He's no longer at the height of his career and I do think people are now saying, I don't care what music he creates, I don't care if he's a musical genius, he has a serious problem with young women and it has to stop.\\nKEILAR: Lola, thank you so much.

Announcing in public, with a video, that he's been diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer.\nHARLOW: He is 78 years old, and he posted this moving message to fans on Wednesday, saying he will fight this.\nALEX TREBEK, HOST, JEOPARDY!: I'm going to fight this. And I'm going to keep working. And with the love and support of my family and friends, and with the help of your prayers, also, I plan to beat the low survival rate statistics for this disease. Truth told? I have to. Because under the terms of my contract, I have to host \"Jeopardy!\" for three more years, so help me.\nHARLOW: Oh. We all want to help him. With us now is our senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen. He's such a staple in so many American households, living rooms, every evening. But you look at the numbers, you know? I think a statistic I read, 95 percent of people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer die. Why?\nELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Right. I mean, the numbers really are so sobering. So, Poppy, what that number is, is that if you look at people with pancreatic cancer that's stage IV, so advanced cancer that's spread to distant parts of the body, five years after that diagnosis, only three percent of them are still alive. Those are not great numbers. Now, the American Cancer Society makes a point of saying, \"Look, this -- you can't predict what's going to happen to any one person.\" And so obviously we are all praying and wishing Alex Trebek the best. But those are sort of the average, the average statistics that talk about what typically happens.\nSCIUTTO: Now, there are folks who survive. And some famous folks who survive, RBG survived pancreatic cancer. And those are hopeful stories, but you don't want it to give undue hope. What are the treatment options that make that more likely?\nCOHEN: Right. So, Jim, what they really try to focus on is chemotherapy for this disease. And doctors are very clear, they're not thinking about curing it at this stage. Really, what they're thinking of is slowing the progression and keeping the patient as comfortable as possible.\nTEXT: Pancreatic Cancer: Most patients are older than 45; Nearly 90 percent are older than 55; Average age of diagnosis is 71\nCOHEN: So mainly, that's chemotherapy. Some patients do get surgery. But it's not the kind of surgery that we hear of, for example, for a lump in a woman's breast, where you're hoping to remove all of it. They don't usually remove all of it because by the time pancreatic cancer is diagnosed, typically is has spread pretty far and it's really impossible to remove all of it.\nHARLOW: So it would all -- I mean, as you noted, the key reason here, why it's so deadly is because of the lack of symptoms, right? It's not like some of the other cancers where you have these symptoms. So it's almost as though if there were something to make it more symptomatic, it would be so helpful.\nCOHEN: Right. It actually would be better, ironically, if people felt sick. But people often don't feel sick at the beginning stages, or at the stage where pancreatic cancer is diagnosed.\nTEXT: Pancreatic Cancer in the\nU.S.: Fourth leading cause of death from cancer; Around 56,770 new cases will be diagnosed this year; Estimated 45,750 people will die from this cancer this year\nCOHEN: So they have pancreatic cancer, it's spread, but they often feel OK. And so the first signs are often things like jaundice or unexplained weight loss, or, oddly enough, itching is also another sign. But, you know, by the time these signs show up, usually the pancreatic cancer has spread. And there are some other reasons why it's so difficult to treat this disease, and why it is so deadly. One of them is that the pancreas is, it's way in there. It is deep in the middle of your abdomen. The organ itself doesn't have any kind of capsule around it, so it really spreads quite quickly.\nHARLOW: Elizabeth Cohen, thank you for reporting --\nCOHEN: Thanks.\nHARLOW: -- this. Alex Trebek, with his humor always, right? We're thinking of you. The Republican-controlled Senate is set to hold a hearing on gun control. This is a big deal.

And I'm going to keep working. And with the love and support of my family and friends, and with the help of your prayers, also, I plan to beat the low survival rate statistics for this disease. Truth told? I have to. Because under the terms of my contract, I have to host \\\"Jeopardy!\\\" for three more years, so help me.\\nHARLOW: Oh. We all want to help him. With us now is our senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen. He's such a staple in so many American households, living rooms, every evening. But you look at the numbers, you know? I think a statistic I read, 95 percent of people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer die. Why?\\nELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Right. I mean, the numbers really are so sobering. So, Poppy, what that number is, is that if you look at people with pancreatic cancer that's stage IV, so advanced cancer that's spread to distant parts of the body, five years after that diagnosis, only three percent of them are still alive. Those are not great numbers. Now, the American Cancer Society makes a point of saying, \\\"Look, this -- you can't predict what's going to happen to any one person.\\\" And so obviously we are all praying and wishing Alex Trebek the best. But those are sort of the average, the average statistics that talk about what typically happens.\\nSCIUTTO: Now, there are folks who survive. And some famous folks who survive, RBG survived pancreatic cancer. And those are hopeful stories, but you don't want it to give undue hope. What are the treatment options that make that more likely?\\nCOHEN: Right. So, Jim, what they really try to focus on is chemotherapy for this disease.

How have you lived your life in the years since you have been released from prison?\nDEMETRIUS ANDERSON, COULD BE SENT BACK TO PRISON OVER CLERICAL ERROR: Like an American, law abiding citizen, doing everything right, working, gainfully employed, involved in my community, involved in my church -- found a church home.

The whole point of the corrections system is to correct people. How can you say at this point 13 years later this man needs correction when he's done everything right? As best we can tell, he hasn't -- he doesn't even have an overdue library book. He's living better than me. He's living better than you. He's doing all the things you want someone to do. And if you're going to say this person, after 13 years of doing nothing wrong, of rebuilding his life, has to go back and do -- and do time, you have literally millions of other people who are out here who are supposed to do the right thing. What's to say that in five years, 10 years, 20 years, somebody's going to go back through the sock drawer and find something to put them back in jail? This doesn't make any sense. When somebody has actually rehabilitated themselves, that's the whole point. He's already done time for this crime and he should get credit for that. And he's -- he should get more credit for 13 years out of trouble. You know the statistics. When people come home from prison, the vast majority, unfortunately, wind up back in trouble very quickly. He has not been back in trouble for 13 years. The only trouble he is in now is because of a bizarre clerical error that could destroy his life.\nBERMAN: And, Van, you worked with Jared Kushner at the White House on criminal justice reform and prison reform. Do you intend to reach out personally to the White House to see if the president will get involved?\nJONES: I have already done so. And we'll see what happens. Here's the deal. I'm going to personally ask President Trump to do something. I'm going to ask everybody I know in the White House to do something. But I think everybody in America should get involved in this case. This is the kind of stuff that's so demoralizing and debilitating for people who are trying -- hey, listen, you -- let me talk about a role model. This is a guy that everybody coming out of prison hopes they will be. You don't grab your role model and throw your role models in jail. You should put your role models on your shoulders and parade them around. And so I'm going to ask, but, you know, also, cut50.org is doing something. I'm a part of the reformalliance.com.

Someone -- either the state of the federal government blew it. And, Demetrus, this is an important point I want to get to before I bring Van in. How have you lived your life in the years since you have been released from prison?\\nDEMETRIUS ANDERSON, COULD BE SENT BACK TO PRISON OVER CLERICAL ERROR: Like an American, law abiding citizen, doing everything right, working, gainfully employed, involved in my community, involved in my church -- found a church home. Just doing everything that I was supposed to do.\\nBERMAN: Now, Van Jones, I want to bring you into this conversation because I think you all saw this story, like so many of us did, in the New Haven papers and in the Yale papers. You look at this and you think this runs counter to the idea of the justice, in quotation marks, system that we have in place.\\nVAN JONES, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, I mean, absolutely. The whole point of the corrections system is to correct people. How can you say at this point 13 years later this man needs correction when he's done everything right? As best we can tell, he hasn't -- he doesn't even have an overdue library book. He's living better than me. He's living better than you. He's doing all the things you want someone to do. And if you're going to say this person, after 13 years of doing nothing wrong, of rebuilding his life, has to go back and do -- and do time, you have literally millions of other people who are out here who are supposed to do the right thing. What's to say that in five years, 10 years, 20 years, somebody's going to go back through the sock drawer and find something to put them back in jail? This doesn't make any sense. When somebody has actually rehabilitated themselves, that's the whole point. He's already done time for this crime and he should get credit for that. And he's -- he should get more credit for 13 years out of trouble. You know the statistics. When people come home from prison, the vast majority, unfortunately, wind up back in trouble very quickly. He has not been back in trouble for 13 years. The only trouble he is in now is because of a bizarre clerical error that could destroy his life.\\nBERMAN: And, Van, you worked with Jared Kushner at the White House on criminal justice reform and prison reform. Do you intend to reach out personally to the White House to see if the president will get involved?\\nJONES: I have already done so. And we'll see what happens. Here's the deal. I'm going to personally ask President Trump to do something. I'm going to ask everybody I know in the White House to do something. But I think everybody in America should get involved in this case. This is the kind of stuff that's so demoralizing and debilitating for people who are trying -- hey, listen, you -- let me talk about a role model. This is a guy that everybody coming out of prison hopes they will be. You don't grab your role model and throw your role models in jail. You should put your role models on your shoulders and parade them around. And so I'm going to ask, but, you know, also, cut50.org is doing something. I'm a part of the reformalliance.com. We are getting involved. Please reach out, help us make this a big issue. It's very rare, obviously, for the president to get involved in something like this, but we think the judges involved should give him credit for time served.

Van, I can't wait to see you for our special on Friday coming. So, Van, I'm going to start with you. Another black man shot dead broad daylight, another video. A family seeking justice at the same time, black Americans are getting pummeled by the coronavirus. Again, how much of this -- how much more of this can we take all at once?\nVAN JONES, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: You know, it's just horrible. You ask the question, what is it OK for us to do? What is it OK for a black man to do? You say, well, you know, we have poor underlying health conditions, it's our fault. You know, we should be in better health. OK, fine. Go jogging. Get in better health and then get killed. You say you have to wear a mask now. I have two teenage boys, they put on a mask, they take the mask off. I'm more afraid of somebody shooting them or arresting them for looking like quote and quote gang members than I'm afraid of this virus. What is it OK for us to do? What is allowed? We're crushed between police violence, vigilante violence. This virus. And anyway we move we feel trapped and nobody has an answer. You know, the last segment I just appreciate you, Don, for being able to hold that space. And for really starting this movement in the way you did. But is it very, very tough right now to be African-American in this situation.\nLEMON: Yes. Dr. Jones. You know, you have seen that disturbing video as a mom, what goes through your mind when you see a young black man out there jogging? I mean, today it would have been his 26th birthday.\nDR. CAMARA JONES, EPIDEMIOLOGIST AND FAMILY PHYSICIAN: Yes, he's just two years older than my son. And every time I see one of those videos then my first impulse is to call my son and say again, be careful. I worry about my husband going out in our neighborhood which is a predominantly white neighborhood at night to take the trash down to the street. And I say, well, let me do it. You know, it is our lives are not valued in this country. And our stories are not believed in this country. Our reality is not believed. Our voices are not heard. It's an invisibilization of our full humanity.\nJONES: I was talking to a --\nLEMON: That plus -- hang on the one second. Let me get this in and you are going to -- that plus the pandemic. What is the impact to the African-American community aside from the sheer exhaustion of having to deal with these things?\nC. JONES: Well, I think that the impact is that we realize that our lives aren't valued by the meat packing plants. You know, our lives aren't valued or don't seem to be valued by these governors that are opening prematurely. That are essential roles have not been fully recognized or valued. Because we still don't have the PPE. We still don't have hazard pay. We still are not -- it's as if we are really, really, really seen as dispensable as animals. And what it reflects is white supremacist ideology. I'm just going to say one thing about that. White supremacist ideology is the idea that there's a hierarchy of human value with white folks at the top. And what we have in this country right now is that people at the top have said these are very fine people. These are good people. You know, encouraging people to bring out their -- I don't know if I want to say this. But I will just say that many of our leaders at the top are surrounding themselves with other people who have a vowed public white supremacist ideas. And so it's a signal to us that white supremacist flags has been waved is being heeded.\nLEMON: Yes. Van, I have to run. But I'll give you the last word. Quickly please, you have been in the seat. You know how that works, can you.\nJONES: Yes. I'll just say I was talking to a very prominent rapper today who said, he lives in a very wealthy neighborhood and he's afraid to leave his own house. He's spent all his money to live in a very wealthy neighborhood. But as an African-American young man he's afraid to leave his own house in that neighborhood for these reasons.\nLEMON: Thank you both.

You know how that works, can you.\nJONES: Yes. I'll just say I was talking to a very prominent rapper today who said, he lives in a very wealthy neighborhood and he's afraid to leave his own house. He's spent all his money to live in a very wealthy neighborhood. But as an African-American young man he's afraid to leave his own house in that neighborhood for these reasons.\nLEMON: Thank you both.

        "\"LEMON: The coronavirus pandemic exacerbating issues facing the black community in the U.S. Issues like basic access to healthcare. Economic security and fair policing. I want to bring in now CNN's Van Jones and Dr. Camara Jones, an epidemiologist and family physician. Thank you both. Good to see both of you again. Van, I can't wait to see you for our special on Friday coming. So, Van, I'm going to start with you. Another black man shot dead broad daylight, another video. A family seeking justice at the same time, black Americans are getting pummeled by the coronavirus. Again, how much of this -- how much more of this can we take all at once?\\nVAN JONES, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: You know, it's just horrible. You ask the question, what is it OK for us to do? What is it OK for a black man to do? You say, well, you know, we have poor underlying health conditions, it's our fault. You know, we should be in better health. OK, fine. Go jogging. Get in better health and then get killed. You say you have to wear a mask now. I have two teenage boys, they put on a mask, they take the mask off. I'm more afraid of somebody shooting them or arresting them for looking like quote and quote gang members than I'm afraid of this virus. What is it OK for us to do? What is allowed? We're crushed between police violence, vigilante violence. This virus. And anyway we move we feel trapped and nobody has an answer. You know, the last segment I just appreciate you, Don, for being able to hold that space. And for really starting this movement in the way you did. But is it very, very tough right now to be African-American in this situation.\\nLEMON: Yes. Dr. Jones. You know, you have seen that disturbing video as a mom, what goes through your mind when you see a young black man out there jogging? I mean, today it would have been his 26th birthday.\\nDR. CAMARA JONES, EPIDEMIOLOGIST AND FAMILY PHYSICIAN: Yes, he's just two years older than my son. And every time I see one of those videos then my first impulse is to call my son and say again, be careful. I worry about my husband going out in our neighborhood which is a predominantly white neighborhood at night to take the trash down to the street. And I say, well, let me do it. You know, it is our lives are not valued in this country. And our stories are not believed in this country. Our reality is not believed. Our voices are not heard. It's an invisibilization of our full humanity.\\nJONES: I was talking to a --\\nLEMON: That plus -- hang on the one second. Let me get this in and you are going to -- that plus the pandemic. What is the impact to the African-American community aside from the sheer exhaustion of having to deal with these things?\\nC. JONES: Well, I think that the impact is that we realize that our lives aren't valued by the meat packing plants. You know, our lives aren't valued or don't seem to be valued by these governors that are opening prematurely. That are essential roles have not been fully recognized or valued. Because we still don't have the PPE. We still don't have hazard pay. We still are not -- it's as if we are really, really, really seen as dispensable as animals. And what it reflects is white supremacist ideology. I'm just going to say one thing about that. White supremacist ideology is the idea that there's a hierarchy of human value with white folks at the top. And what we have in this country right now is that people at the top have said these are very fine people. These are good people. You know, encouraging people to bring out their -- I don't know if I want to say this.

CAROL LIN, CNN ANCHOR: Well one thing that Mullah Omar has made perfectly clear: Anybody who opposes the Taliban could be subjected to the death penalty. Well, clearly the opposition in northern Afghanistan is in its fight with the Taliban and that's where we find CNN's Matthew Chance. Matthew, some battles going on, some prisoners taken, what is the Northern Alliance learning?\nMATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right. Carol, there is a lot of renewed activity here in this very hot and dusty part of northern Afghanistan. The latest reports that we've been receiving are from several hundred kilometers from where I'm standing right now, reports, though, coming from General Fahim who is the military commander of those anti-Taliban Northern Alliance forces. He said that on Tuesday his men launched an attack on Taliban positions, hundreds of kilometers, as I say, from where I'm standing right now, managed to capture some 15 square kilometers of very rugged terrain but also as part of that, 75 Taliban fighters, he said, along with three quite important senior Taliban commanders. Now one of the things that's been coming out from officials here at the Northern Alliance headquarters is that one of the problems they're seeing a lot more of they say are fighters from other countries outside of Afghanistan, from the Arab states. From countries specifically like Pakistan, they say, who are coming and fighting alongside the Taliban. Now this has been happening throughout the long-running civil war here in Afghanistan. Many of those people have been captured, along with Taliban fighters, and a lot of them are held in prisoner of war camps in the heart of the -- of the Northern Alliance stronghold in the Panjshir Valley.\nCHANCE (voice-over): Captives from years of bitter Afghan conflicts, devout Muslims but still hardened fighters who've battle on the side of the Taliban and others but lost. Most are native Afghans, but there are nationals here from Yemen, Iraq, even China, all held by the Northern Alliance as prisoners of war. Sola Adin told me he's from Pakistan, an Islamic fighter, he said, trained on Afghan soil in a base run by none other than Osama bin Laden. The claim is impossible to verify and made within earshot of prison guards.\nSOLA ADIN, PRISONER OF WAR: When our enemy he was very strong and we was weak and we cannot fight face to face with our enemy and that time we fight -- terrorism.\nCHANCE: So what kind of things are we talking about? We're talking about bombings? We're talking about kidnappings?\nADIN: Bombings and killing the sniper and hijacking and every very much.\nCHANCE: Off camera he said he spoke under duress. The warning shots are from guards high above this isolated prison. Three times a day there are prayers outside in the windswept Panjshir Valley. Northern Alliance commanders say each of these captives is investigated to extract, in their words, any useful information. \"We can gather very important intelligence on enemy bases and military strategy,\" this prison official said. \"It's information the Americans could also use,\" he said, \"if they would ask.\" There are reports of contact with Washington. Most of these fighters have already been held for years, too long to be of much intelligence gathering use. (on camera): There's word here the coming days could bring more prisoners from a fresh upsurge in fighting in the mountains behind me and perhaps also with fresh information not just on the Taliban but, according to Northern Alliance officials here, on the organization of Osama bin Laden himself. (voice-over): It may be prisoners in Afghanistan's long-running civil war that prove one vital source ahead of any U.S.-led attack.\nCHANCE: Let's turn briefly now to the diplomatic efforts underway. And I spoke earlier today local time to the Foreign Minister of the Northern Alliance, Dr. Abdallah Abdallah. And he told me that there was still daily contacts he said between him, between his officials and officials of the United States administration. He said the entire range of options was being discussed with them, including the military one. He wouldn't go any further than that though and tell us exactly what was being discussed. But he did hint to us again very strongly that in his mind and in the minds of senior Northern Alliance officials here they are expecting in the days or weeks ahead some kind of attack possibly in conjunction with their forces on Afghanistan by the United States -- Carol.\nLIN: All right, and they have been saying that from the very beginning so we'll see what happens.

Well, clearly the opposition in northern Afghanistan is in its fight with the Taliban and that's where we find CNN's Matthew Chance. Matthew, some battles going on, some prisoners taken, what is the Northern Alliance learning?\\nMATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right. Carol, there is a lot of renewed activity here in this very hot and dusty part of northern Afghanistan. The latest reports that we've been receiving are from several hundred kilometers from where I'm standing right now, reports, though, coming from General Fahim who is the military commander of those anti-Taliban Northern Alliance forces. He said that on Tuesday his men launched an attack on Taliban positions, hundreds of kilometers, as I say, from where I'm standing right now, managed to capture some 15 square kilometers of very rugged terrain but also as part of that, 75 Taliban fighters, he said, along with three quite important senior Taliban commanders. Now one of the things that's been coming out from officials here at the Northern Alliance headquarters is that one of the problems they're seeing a lot more of they say are fighters from other countries outside of Afghanistan, from the Arab states. From countries specifically like Pakistan, they say, who are coming and fighting alongside the Taliban. Now this has been happening throughout the long-running civil war here in Afghanistan. Many of those people have been captured, along with Taliban fighters, and a lot of them are held in prisoner of war camps in the heart of the -- of the Northern Alliance stronghold in the Panjshir Valley.\\nCHANCE (voice-over): Captives from years of bitter Afghan conflicts, devout Muslims but still hardened fighters who've battle on the side of the Taliban and others but lost. Most are native Afghans, but there are nationals here from Yemen, Iraq, even China, all held by the Northern Alliance as prisoners of war. Sola Adin told me he's from Pakistan, an Islamic fighter, he said, trained on Afghan soil in a base run by none other than Osama bin Laden. The claim is impossible to verify and made within earshot of prison guards.\\nSOLA ADIN, PRISONER OF WAR: When our enemy he was very strong and we was weak and we cannot fight face to face with our enemy and that time we fight -- terrorism.\\nCHANCE: So what kind of things are we talking about? We're talking about bombings? We're talking about kidnappings?\\nADIN: Bombings and killing the sniper and hijacking and every very much.\\nCHANCE: Off camera he said he spoke under duress. The warning shots are from guards high above this isolated prison. Three times a day there are prayers outside in the windswept Panjshir Valley. Northern Alliance commanders say each of these captives is investigated to extract, in their words, any useful information. \\\"We can gather very important intelligence on enemy bases and military strategy,\\\" this prison official said. \\\"It's information the Americans could also use,\\\" he said, \\\"if they would ask.\\\" There are reports of contact with Washington. Most of these fighters have already been held for years, too long to be of much intelligence gathering use. (on camera): There's word here the coming days could bring more prisoners from a fresh upsurge in fighting in the mountains behind me and perhaps also with fresh information not just on the Taliban but, according to Northern Alliance officials here, on the organization of Osama bin Laden himself. (voice-over): It may be prisoners in Afghanistan's long-running civil war that prove one vital source ahead of any U.S.-led attack.\\nCHANCE: Let's turn briefly now to the diplomatic efforts underway. And I spoke earlier today local time to the Foreign Minister of the Northern Alliance, Dr. Abdallah Abdallah. And he told me that there was still daily contacts he said between him, between his officials and officials of the United States administration. He said the entire range of options was being discussed with them, including the military one. He wouldn't go any further than that though and tell us exactly what was being discussed. But he did hint to us again very strongly that in his mind and in the minds of senior Northern Alliance officials here they are expecting in the days or weeks ahead some kind of attack possibly in conjunction with their forces on Afghanistan by the United States -- Carol.\\nLIN: All right, and they have been saying that from the very beginning so we'll see what happens. Thank you very much. Matthew Chance reporting live from northern Afghanistan. He is with the Northern Alliance in their civil war.

    "source": "THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.  THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. PAULA ZAHN, CNN ANCHOR: On to the issue of Iraq. Iraq's deputy foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, today said that Iraq is anticipating and preparing for a U.S. assault. But this morning, that same country is sending its foreign minister to New York to meet face to face with United Nations officials for the first time in over a year. But is all of this simply a diversion to hold off any possible U.S. military action? Well, joining us now is a man that knows an awful lot about all of this, Richard Butler, a former U.N. weapons inspector himself in Iraq, our ambassador-in-residence, though today he is not quite in residence. He is in his hometown of Sydney, Australia -- good morning, Richard. Do you miss us?\nRICHARD BUTLER, FORMER U.N. CHIEF WEAPONS INSPECTOR: Good morning, Paula. I sure do. I don't miss those reports of snow that's coming down the pike, especially as I was surfing this afternoon, but I sure do miss you guys. And you've got a lot of interesting stories on your hands right now.\nZAHN: Yes, we do. Let's have you walk us through this dance that is expected to happen later...\nBUTLER: Right.\nZAHN: ... today at the U.N. This happens at a time, when the U.S. government now has satellite pictures showing the Iraqis have turned trucks that were meant for humanitarian use into military trucks.\nBUTLER: Well, Paula, the Iraqis have had three years to do such things, three years without inspections, and throughout that period, they have claimed that they have no weapons of mass destruction. I want to say very simply that's a lie. And as Colin Powell has said very often, if that is the truth, why not have inspectors come back and look and see and prove to the world that you don't have any of those weapons? Well, here they are today at the U.N. talking about having inspectors come back. That's a real wrench for them, because Saddam's deepest interest is in keeping weapons of mass destruction and, therefore, not having inspectors. So why are they doing this? Paula, they are doing it, because they are scared stiff of U.S. military action, and this is a ploy to try to head off that action by saying, hey, wait a minute. We are going to come back under the law. We are going to have inspectors come into our country. That's what it's about.\nZAHN: But, Richard, realistically how much time can the Iraqis buy here?\nBUTLER: I don't think very much, and the devil will be in the detail. You see, Kofi Annan, the secretary general, has made clear that there is only one subject on the agenda, which is that you come back -- you, Iraq, come back into conformity with the law, and the law says they must be inspected and those weapons of mass destruction removed. What Iraq will do is say, OK, we are prepared to do that, but we want to know exactly what those inspections will look like, what will be the rules. In other words, they will start, I think, that same game they have played with my team in the past, a sort of shell game, where through procedural and other devices, they will seek to prevent the inspections from being effective. That's what the U.S. has to watch out for, because if it looks like the secretary general or the international community is going to allow Iraq to have inspections, but inspections which are useless, some would say worse than useless, then that will be a serious problem. I don't think they'll get away with it. They are going to try it, but the short answer to your question is that, no, I don't think it will work.\nZAHN: All right. But how much does it hurt the Iraqis' case that this information has become public now, 24 hours in advance of these important high-level meetings, that they have converted these trucks into trucks of wartime use potentially?\nBUTLER: Well, I think it does hurt their case, but let's not be too sanguine about that. This sort of information has been around for a very long time, but Iraq has had sufficient supporters -- political supporters to try to water it down or dismiss its significance. Some will argue that this information has come to light on the eve of these talks and is therefore in some way an attempt to prejudice the, you know, the outcome of those talks. The politics of this are very complex. Now, they had clarified somewhat since September 11, and certainly in the Iraqi mind, the president got their attention with his State of the Union speech, when he made very clear that the U.S. is not going to sit back and wait for countries like Iraq, declared to be part of the so-called axis of evil, to develop weapons of mass destruction. That if it's seen that they have them, the U.S. will take action first. Now, in the meantime, it has been made clear that before that action takes place, there will be one more attempt to get serious inspections back into Iraq. This is what we are seeing unfold today. Will it work? Will it result in serious inspections? Will it hold off U.S. action? I strongly doubt it, because Saddam's first and basic interest is in keeping his weapons of mass destruction, and frankly I think whatever inspections are agreed to, it probably won't be real.\nZAHN: Well, we are going to be watching this very closely from here at CNN -- Richard, good to see you again. We are very jealous that you have been surfing, but we can't complain too badly about the weather here.\nBUTLER: Well, I'll be back with you soon, I hope.\nZAHN: Travel well. Thank you, Ambassador Richard Butler...\nBUTLER: Thank you.\nZAHN: ... for your preview of what might happen at the U.N. later today. Preparing for U.S. Assault>",

        "\"THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.  THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. PAULA ZAHN, CNN ANCHOR: On to the issue of Iraq. Iraq's deputy foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, today said that Iraq is anticipating and preparing for a U.S. assault. But this morning, that same country is sending its foreign minister to New York to meet face to face with United Nations officials for the first time in over a year. But is all of this simply a diversion to hold off any possible U.S. military action? Well, joining us now is a man that knows an awful lot about all of this, Richard Butler, a former U.N. weapons inspector himself in Iraq, our ambassador-in-residence, though today he is not quite in residence. He is in his hometown of Sydney, Australia -- good morning, Richard. Do you miss us?\\nRICHARD BUTLER, FORMER U.N. CHIEF WEAPONS INSPECTOR: Good morning, Paula. I sure do. I don't miss those reports of snow that's coming down the pike, especially as I was surfing this afternoon, but I sure do miss you guys. And you've got a lot of interesting stories on your hands right now.\\nZAHN: Yes, we do. Let's have you walk us through this dance that is expected to happen later...\\nBUTLER: Right.\\nZAHN: ... today at the U.N. This happens at a time, when the U.S. government now has satellite pictures showing the Iraqis have turned trucks that were meant for humanitarian use into military trucks.\\nBUTLER: Well, Paula, the Iraqis have had three years to do such things, three years without inspections, and throughout that period, they have claimed that they have no weapons of mass destruction. I want to say very simply that's a lie. And as Colin Powell has said very often, if that is the truth, why not have inspectors come back and look and see and prove to the world that you don't have any of those weapons? Well, here they are today at the U.N. talking about having inspectors come back. That's a real wrench for them, because Saddam's deepest interest is in keeping weapons of mass destruction and, therefore, not having inspectors. So why are they doing this? Paula, they are doing it, because they are scared stiff of U.S. military action, and this is a ploy to try to head off that action by saying, hey, wait a minute. We are going to come back under the law. We are going to have inspectors come into our country. That's what it's about.\\nZAHN: But, Richard, realistically how much time can the Iraqis buy here?\\nBUTLER: I don't think very much, and the devil will be in the detail. You see, Kofi Annan, the secretary general, has made clear that there is only one subject on the agenda, which is that you come back -- you, Iraq, come back into conformity with the law, and the law says they must be inspected and those weapons of mass destruction removed. What Iraq will do is say, OK, we are prepared to do that, but we want to know exactly what those inspections will look like, what will be the rules. In other words, they will start, I think, that same game they have played with my team in the past, a sort of shell game, where through procedural and other devices, they will seek to prevent the inspections from being effective. That's what the U.S. has to watch out for, because if it looks like the secretary general or the international community is going to allow Iraq to have inspections, but inspections which are useless, some would say worse than useless, then that will be a serious problem. I don't think they'll get away with it. They are going to try it, but the short answer to your question is that, no, I don't think it will work.\\nZAHN: All right. But how much does it hurt the Iraqis' case that this information has become public now, 24 hours in advance of these important high-level meetings, that they have converted these trucks into trucks of wartime use potentially?\\nBUTLER: Well, I think it does hurt their case, but let's not be too sanguine about that. This sort of information has been around for a very long time, but Iraq has had sufficient supporters -- political supporters to try to water it down or dismiss its significance. Some will argue that this information has come to light on the eve of these talks and is therefore in some way an attempt to prejudice the, you know, the outcome of those talks. The politics of this are very complex. Now, they had clarified somewhat since September 11, and certainly in the Iraqi mind, the president got their attention with his State of the Union speech, when he made very clear that the U.S. is not going to sit back and wait for countries like Iraq, declared to be part of the so-called axis of evil, to develop weapons of mass destruction. That if it's seen that they have them, the U.S. will take action first. Now, in the meantime, it has been made clear that before that action takes place, there will be one more attempt to get serious inspections back into Iraq. This is what we are seeing unfold today. Will it work? Will it result in serious inspections? Will it hold off U.S. action? I strongly doubt it, because Saddam's first and basic interest is in keeping his weapons of mass destruction, and frankly I think whatever inspections are agreed to, it probably won't be real.\\nZAHN: Well, we are going to be watching this very closely from here at CNN -- Richard, good to see you again.

Our guest this morning is bringing us his first live interview from Williamsburg, where he is at the convention of CEOs. Sandy Weill is chairman and chief executive of Travelers -- or Citigroup now it is known, and is joining us from the Business Council Summit in West Virginia. We welcome you.\nSANDFORD WEILL, CITIGROUP CHAIRMAN & CEO: Thank you.\nDAVID HAFFENREFFER, CNN ANCHOR: Mr. Weill, I do want to begin, first of all, with the Federal Reserve. Everybody is seemingly talking about their expectations for what the Federal Reserve will be doing come Tuesday. Are you in the 25 or 50 basis point camp, and what are your impressions of the Fed's strategy for shaping the economy now?\nWEILL: Well, you know, I think the Fed has been trying to cool off the economy for the last year. We've had five 25 basis point increases already, and I would expect, as everybody else does, that we will have another one this coming week. Whether they do 25 basis points and continue to say that there's an outlook for further increases or they do 50 now and indicate, possibly, that they may slow down in the increases, I don't think it's really that important. I think that what they have done is beginning to affect the economy, and I think we're beginning to see the beginning of a slowdown in the economy.\nMARCHINI: It certainly has affected the stock market, we're seeing intense amounts of volatility there. What does that say to you?\nWEILL: Well, I think that we really went through a period where there was indiscriminate buying of a lot of the high-tech stocks, and I think when you think about the Internet, it's going to really revolutionize and transform our global economies, but yet, a lot of these companies that are public today won't be in existence five years from now. But I do believe that the value of all those technology stocks five years from now, as a collective, will be a lot higher than it is today.\nHAFFENREFFER: Are you concerned how a higher interest rate environment here in the U.S. might impact your shares of Citigroup?\nWEILL: I think our company is not really that affected by interest-rate increases of 100 or 150 basis points. We had had over a hundred basis point increase in rates, and yet, in the first quarter, we earned $3.6 billion, which was up 50 percent from the year before. So our company is doing very well.\nMARCHINI: When you look at the economy overall, what's your sense of it? Do you think that things are going along well?\nWEILL: You know, I think that the U.S. economy was really growing too fast, that the labor market got very, very tight, which is creating a problem for a whole host of companies in being difficult to replace workers and costs are going up somewhat. So I think that the U.S. economy cooling down a low bit is good. However, if you look around a world, the global economy is really in terrific shape: Asia's growing, Latin America's growing, Europe is starting to grow. So I think we are in an environment, from a global perspective, that is really terrific. And since this world is becoming a smaller place and we trade with each other much, much more, I think that that's really the important key to the outlook, so therefore I'm very optimistic.\nHAFFENREFFER: You speak of global growth and international growth. Yesterday, Citigroup took one step closer to the purchase of Poland's biggest corporate bank. Is Citigroup essentially done expanding in the U.S. and more angling toward growth overseas?\nWEILL: I think that we still like the U.S. market for financial services and are looking to grow some parts of our business, but we think that the growth rate in the emerging markets is going to be far higher than that in the United States. So, as you mentioned, we're buying Bank Hanloi (ph) in Poland. We're very optimistic about the Polish economy long-term. Last week, I was in Asia and we announced a strategic relationship with the Fubon Group in Taiwan with an intention to grow our insurance businesses through Asia together with them.\nMARCHINI: All right, well, clearly, you're going to be a busy man.

And since this world is becoming a smaller place and we trade with each other much, much more, I think that that's really the important key to the outlook, so therefore I'm very optimistic.\nHAFFENREFFER: You speak of global growth and international growth. Yesterday, Citigroup took one step closer to the purchase of Poland's biggest corporate bank. Is Citigroup essentially done expanding in the U.S. and more angling toward growth overseas?\nWEILL: I think that we still like the U.S. market for financial services and are looking to grow some parts of our business, but we think that the growth rate in the emerging markets is going to be far higher than that in the United States. So, as you mentioned, we're buying Bank Hanloi (ph) in Poland. We're very optimistic about the Polish economy long-term.

        "\"DEBORAH MARCHINI, CNN ANCHOR: Where better to get a picture of financial market activity and the economy than at the helm of the nation's largest financial institution and one that is growing. Our guest this morning is bringing us his first live interview from Williamsburg, where he is at the convention of CEOs. Sandy Weill is chairman and chief executive of Travelers -- or Citigroup now it is known, and is joining us from the Business Council Summit in West Virginia. We welcome you.\\nSANDFORD WEILL, CITIGROUP CHAIRMAN & CEO: Thank you.\\nDAVID HAFFENREFFER, CNN ANCHOR: Mr. Weill, I do want to begin, first of all, with the Federal Reserve. Everybody is seemingly talking about their expectations for what the Federal Reserve will be doing come Tuesday. Are you in the 25 or 50 basis point camp, and what are your impressions of the Fed's strategy for shaping the economy now?\\nWEILL: Well, you know, I think the Fed has been trying to cool off the economy for the last year. We've had five 25 basis point increases already, and I would expect, as everybody else does, that we will have another one this coming week. Whether they do 25 basis points and continue to say that there's an outlook for further increases or they do 50 now and indicate, possibly, that they may slow down in the increases, I don't think it's really that important. I think that what they have done is beginning to affect the economy, and I think we're beginning to see the beginning of a slowdown in the economy.\\nMARCHINI: It certainly has affected the stock market, we're seeing intense amounts of volatility there. What does that say to you?\\nWEILL: Well, I think that we really went through a period where there was indiscriminate buying of a lot of the high-tech stocks, and I think when you think about the Internet, it's going to really revolutionize and transform our global economies, but yet, a lot of these companies that are public today won't be in existence five years from now. But I do believe that the value of all those technology stocks five years from now, as a collective, will be a lot higher than it is today.\\nHAFFENREFFER: Are you concerned how a higher interest rate environment here in the U.S. might impact your shares of Citigroup?\\nWEILL: I think our company is not really that affected by interest-rate increases of 100 or 150 basis points. We had had over a hundred basis point increase in rates, and yet, in the first quarter, we earned $3.6 billion, which was up 50 percent from the year before. So our company is doing very well.\\nMARCHINI: When you look at the economy overall, what's your sense of it? Do you think that things are going along well?\\nWEILL: You know, I think that the U.S. economy was really growing too fast, that the labor market got very, very tight, which is creating a problem for a whole host of companies in being difficult to replace workers and costs are going up somewhat. So I think that the U.S. economy cooling down a low bit is good. However, if you look around a world, the global economy is really in terrific shape: Asia's growing, Latin America's growing, Europe is starting to grow. So I think we are in an environment, from a global perspective, that is really terrific. And since this world is becoming a smaller place and we trade with each other much, much more, I think that that's really the important key to the outlook, so therefore I'm very optimistic.\\nHAFFENREFFER: You speak of global growth and international growth.

    "source": "ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: If you've had a baby, you're probably familiar with this problem. You're out of the house. Your baby needs a diaper change, and you can't find a bathroom with a changing table. You've probably resorted to a public diaper changing. It's a little awkward for everyone involved. But when the person who needs that diaper change is a disabled or elderly adult, it can be worse than awkward.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: Around the country, there are a handful of places that have installed private family restrooms equipped with adult changing tables. The airports in Phoenix, Baltimore and Orlando are a few. Sabrina Kimball of Tallahassee would like to see many more of them. She founded a group called Universal Changing Places and now joins us on the program. Welcome.\nSABRINA KIMBALL: Yes, thank you so much for having me.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: I'd like you to tell us the story of how you encountered this problem with your teenage son, Greyson, who had bacterial meningitis, I guess, as a very small child.\nSABRINA KIMBALL: Yes, Greyson contracted bacterial meningitis when he was a baby. He was premature. And he developed it when he was 10 days old. And unfortunately, it caused a lot of developmental delays and cerebral palsy. So Greyson is non-ambulatory. He's now 19, and he weighs about almost 75 pounds. And this has become a big challenge for us as we go out in public to try to include him in different activities.\nSABRINA KIMBALL: There is no safe clean place to change him. He has out - he outgrew the baby changing tables years ago. And what we're advocating for are powered height-adjustable adult changing tables to be added to family restrooms in different venues so that people have a safe clean place, and they're not resorting to either leaving the venue or laying their loved one on a public restroom floor.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: In the absence of such facilities, what do you do? What happens?\nSABRINA KIMBALL: Mainly I leave. If I can't find - like if I'm at a mall, I will look in dressing rooms and try to see if there might be a bench that we might awkwardly do a seat cover change, but most of the time we leave, you know, unless it's a major accident. And then, you know, we have had to take out our pad and try to do something on a floor, which is, you know, not something I enjoy doing at all.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: You spoke of a seat cover change.\nSABRINA KIMBALL: (Laughter) Oh, I'm sorry. That is my nickname. As Greyson's gotten older, instead of saying a diaper change, I call them seat covers. It just sounded better because he's older.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: What are you hoping to see? What would be a reasonable public response to this problem.\nSABRINA KIMBALL: What we're hoping to see is that more and more venues like our hospitals, our malls, our rest areas, our airports will add these to their family restrooms so that you do have this facility to change somebody. It seems like such a simple thing, but it's a major thing for people that have older adults that are non-ambulatory or have self-care issues.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: It would seem to me this eliminates both a terrible physical inconvenience you'd be posed with but also some embarrassment, I should think that it addresses.\nSABRINA KIMBALL: Yes. But also, it's an area of dignity for that person, too. I mean, how many people if you have an accident like that want to have to stay in that until they get home because there is no place to change them?\nSABRINA KIMBALL: And I talked to a gentleman when I first started my campaign. He is a quadriplegic. And the one thing he mentioned to me when I first told him about what I was doing, he said, you don't want to know how many bathroom floors I've laid on in my life. And I was like - it just broke my heart. I'm thinking this is not right. This is something we can do something about.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: That is Sabrina Kimball speaking to us via Skype from Tallahassee.

He was premature. And he developed it when he was 10 days old. And unfortunately, it caused a lot of developmental delays and cerebral palsy. So Greyson is non-ambulatory. He's now 19, and he weighs about almost 75 pounds. And this has become a big challenge for us as we go out in public to try to include him in different activities.\nSABRINA KIMBALL: There is no safe clean place to change him. He has out - he outgrew the baby changing tables years ago. And what we're advocating for are powered height-adjustable adult changing tables to be added to family restrooms in different venues so that people have a safe clean place, and they're not resorting to either leaving the venue or laying their loved one on a public restroom floor.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: In the absence of such facilities, what do you do? What happens?\nSABRINA KIMBALL: Mainly I leave. If I can't find - like if I'm at a mall, I will look in dressing rooms and try to see if there might be a bench that we might awkwardly do a seat cover change, but most of the time we leave, you know, unless it's a major accident. And then, you know, we have had to take out our pad and try to do something on a floor, which is, you know, not something I enjoy doing at all.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: You spoke of a seat cover change.\nSABRINA KIMBALL: (Laughter) Oh, I'm sorry. That is my nickname. As Greyson's gotten older, instead of saying a diaper change, I call them seat covers. It just sounded better because he's older.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: What are you hoping to see? What would be a reasonable public response to this problem.\nSABRINA KIMBALL: What we're hoping to see is that more and more venues like our hospitals, our malls, our rest areas, our airports will add these to their family restrooms so that you do have this facility to change somebody. It seems like such a simple thing, but it's a major thing for people that have older adults that are non-ambulatory or have self-care issues.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: It would seem to me this eliminates both a terrible physical inconvenience you'd be posed with but also some embarrassment, I should think that it addresses.\nSABRINA KIMBALL: Yes. But also, it's an area of dignity for that person, too. I mean, how many people if you have an accident like that want to have to stay in that until they get home because there is no place to change them?\nSABRINA KIMBALL: And I talked to a gentleman when I first started my campaign. He is a quadriplegic. And the one thing he mentioned to me when I first told him about what I was doing, he said, you don't want to know how many bathroom floors I've laid on in my life. And I was like - it just broke my heart. I'm thinking this is not right. This is something we can do something about.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: That is Sabrina Kimball speaking to us via Skype from Tallahassee. She's the founder of the Florida-based group Universal Changing Places. Thanks for talking with us.\nSABRINA KIMBALL: Well, thank you so much for having me.",

Their group is called May We Help. Handymen, technicians and engineers volunteer to make devices that help people with disabilities do things that others take for granted. Cheri Lawson of member station WNKU introduces us to one of the members.\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: Bill Sand loves to spend time in his basement. He calls it his man cave, but there's no big screen TV, sound system or beer cooler here.\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: Just power tools and whatever else he needs to build things.\nBILL SAND: So these will go through the planer a few more times.\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: This 66-year-old is like a lot of guys who tinker. But here's where Bill's a bit different. He designs and builds devices for people with disabilities - and he does it for free.\nBILL SAND: These are gifts that are special, that are life-changing.\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: Here in his home workshop, Bill has made a custom scooter for a little girl who can't walk, and cello stands for sisters, even though they don't have arms. Twelve-year-old Inga and 10-year-old Ylena Elena Petry of Pennsylvania play with their feet.\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: Their mom, Jennifer, says the girls used to prop their instruments on pillows on the floor. But that didn't really work out.\nJENNIFER PETRY: We needed something to keep the cellos steady.\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: Inga uses her toes for everything, from eating to texting.\nJENNIFER PETRY: When my mom told me that we were going to get something so that my cello wouldn't wobble, I was really happy because I'd be able to play it better.\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: The Petrys are just one of the families Bill has helped pursue their dreams. He's made several one-of-a-kind devices for nine-year-old Ireland Reed. She has a rare genetic condition called Miller's Syndrome. She needs a special walker just to stand. Bill has become a regular visitor to Ireland's home in suburban Cincinnati.\nBILL SAND: Hello, Amy.\nAMY REID: Hello. How are you?\nBILL SAND: Good.\nAMY REID: Ireland, it's Bill.\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: Ireland is excited to see Bill, and she rolls over to him on the scooter he made for her. The family calls it her shamrock express. It's given her mobility she'd never had before. Ireland's mom, Amy, calls Bill a godsend.\nAMY REID: It's like, how do you know? Bill, how do you know what we need when we don't even know what we need?\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: During this visit, Amy says Ireland is having trouble writing with her partially formed hand. Bill crouches so he can watch carefully as the child tries to hold a pencil. He puts his hand gently around hers, thinking about what he can do to help.\nBILL SAND: Ireland, I just want your hand. You just put your hand like this.\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: He brainstorms with Amy about what he might come up with but says even a simple solution might take five or six tries.\nBILL SAND: I'm thinking of something that'll glide real easy, that her hand is actually sitting on. Kind of like a mouse.\nAMY REID: We can't thank him enough. I can't find the words to really tell you how it's helped us and helped Ireland.\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: Bill Sand has done dozens of projects for families like the Reeds and Petrys.\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: Jennifer Petry says the mahogany cello stands Bill crafted for her kids are not only practical but beautiful.\nJENNIFER PETRY: Just so beautiful.

        "\"STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Being disabled does not have to be a disadvantage. That's the old saying anyway. And some people in Cincinnati want to live up to it. Their group is called May We Help. Handymen, technicians and engineers volunteer to make devices that help people with disabilities do things that others take for granted. Cheri Lawson of member station WNKU introduces us to one of the members.\\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: Bill Sand loves to spend time in his basement. He calls it his man cave, but there's no big screen TV, sound system or beer cooler here.\\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: Just power tools and whatever else he needs to build things.\\nBILL SAND: So these will go through the planer a few more times.\\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: This 66-year-old is like a lot of guys who tinker. But here's where Bill's a bit different. He designs and builds devices for people with disabilities - and he does it for free.\\nBILL SAND: These are gifts that are special, that are life-changing.\\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: Here in his home workshop, Bill has made a custom scooter for a little girl who can't walk, and cello stands for sisters, even though they don't have arms. Twelve-year-old Inga and 10-year-old Ylena Elena Petry of Pennsylvania play with their feet.\\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: Their mom, Jennifer, says the girls used to prop their instruments on pillows on the floor. But that didn't really work out.\\nJENNIFER PETRY: We needed something to keep the cellos steady.\\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: Inga uses her toes for everything, from eating to texting.\\nJENNIFER PETRY: When my mom told me that we were going to get something so that my cello wouldn't wobble, I was really happy because I'd be able to play it better.\\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: The Petrys are just one of the families Bill has helped pursue their dreams. He's made several one-of-a-kind devices for nine-year-old Ireland Reed. She has a rare genetic condition called Miller's Syndrome. She needs a special walker just to stand. Bill has become a regular visitor to Ireland's home in suburban Cincinnati.\\nBILL SAND: Hello, Amy.\\nAMY REID: Hello. How are you?\\nBILL SAND: Good.\\nAMY REID: Ireland, it's Bill.\\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: Ireland is excited to see Bill, and she rolls over to him on the scooter he made for her. The family calls it her shamrock express. It's given her mobility she'd never had before. Ireland's mom, Amy, calls Bill a godsend.\\nAMY REID: It's like, how do you know? Bill, how do you know what we need when we don't even know what we need?\\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: During this visit, Amy says Ireland is having trouble writing with her partially formed hand. Bill crouches so he can watch carefully as the child tries to hold a pencil. He puts his hand gently around hers, thinking about what he can do to help.\\nBILL SAND: Ireland, I just want your hand. You just put your hand like this.\\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: He brainstorms with Amy about what he might come up with but says even a simple solution might take five or six tries.\\nBILL SAND: I'm thinking of something that'll glide real easy, that her hand is actually sitting on. Kind of like a mouse.\\nAMY REID: We can't thank him enough. I can't find the words to really tell you how it's helped us and helped Ireland.\\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: Bill Sand has done dozens of projects for families like the Reeds and Petrys.\\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: Jennifer Petry says the mahogany cello stands Bill crafted for her kids are not only practical but beautiful.\\nJENNIFER PETRY: Just so beautiful. And I thought these are cello stands that my girls can get on stage with and not be ashamed.\\nBILL SAND: I get to be Santa all year round. You know, every time I do a project, it's like Christmas all over.\\nCHERI LAWSON, BYLINE: The group May We Help is hoping to expand beyond its roots in the Midwest. They're talking about setting up a chapter in Florida and hope it will be the start to help millions of children and adults to pursue their passions despite their disabilities.

    "source": "ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: Conservative talk radio host Neal Boortz announced this morning that he is retiring after more than 40 years on the air.\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN: Flying high for decades, Boortz is reaching for the rip cord. But until he's on final approach, the oratorical aerobatics continue. It's the Boortz Happy Ending.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: Boortz has been broadcasting since Richard Nixon was president. And he says he's giving up his nationally syndicated program on WSB Radio in Atlanta because it's too restrictive.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: NPR's Kathy Lohr has the story.\nKATHY LOHR, BYLINE: Neal Boortz, who calls himself The Talkmaster, says he got off the bus in Atlanta in 1967 and did whatever he could to make a living while he was trying to get a job on the radio. He was a jewelry buyer, an insurance salesman; he loaded trucks and wrote speeches for former Georgia Governor Lester Maddox.\nNEAL BOORTZ: All this time, I'm just trying to get into radio - anything. I'll be a reporter. I'll be a cameraman for a TV station. Everybody told me, you don't have any experience. I mean, you don't know what you are doing. Get out of here.\nKATHY LOHR, BYLINE: Then a local radio host committed suicide in 1969 and Boortz says he camped out at the station early the next morning to talk to the general manager.\nNEAL BOORTZ: Well, OK, you can do it for a couple of weeks until we get a replacement in here for that show. So, they put me on that afternoon - 90 minutes. And two weeks later, they moved me to the morning show, and then that was it.\nKATHY LOHR, BYLINE: Four decades later, Boortz says he's ready to call it quits.\nNEAL BOORTZ: It's just been a total and absolute joy. Now, I'm going to miss everything associated with doing a talk radio show.\nKATHY LOHR, BYLINE: About six million listeners a week tune into the Neal Boortz Show. He's a conservative yet independent voice. Boortz is a libertarian, and during the most recent Republican campaign for president has urged his listeners not to focus on social issues, including abortion and gay marriage. He is not a shock jock, but he attacks controversial issues head on. On a program last year, Boortz spoke with Herman Cain about disparaging comments being made about the former GOP presidential candidate.\nNEAL BOORTZ: They called you a monkey, Herman. You're the monkey in the window.\nHERMAN CAIN: Free at last, free at last. Thank God almighty, I'm free at last.\nNEAL BOORTZ: OK. Now, let me ask you something.\nHERMAN CAIN: Yes.\nNEAL BOORTZ: Are you a runaway slave?\nHERMAN CAIN: If you consider leaving the Democrat plantation, yes.\nMICHAEL HARRISON: He is a force that has influence within politics and public policy, but he's also entertaining and funny.\nKATHY LOHR, BYLINE: Michael Harrison is publisher of Talkers Magazine.\nMICHAEL HARRISON: Although he may agree with Limbaugh and Hannity and some of the other big names in conservative talk radio, he is in no way a follower. He has always gone his own direction. He's very independent and quite unique.\nKATHY LOHR, BYLINE: Perhaps not a complete surprise. Herman Cain, who has had a nightly talk show on the same radio station, will take over Boortz's morning slot on January 21st. That's inauguration day. Here's how Boortz put it.\nNEAL BOORTZ: If it's Barack Obama, then I'm going to disappear into the mountains somewhere and come out after he has completely destroyed this country. If it is Mitt Romney, then we're all going to leave the air - well, we're going to start drinking, we'll start drinking as the show begins. And...\nKATHY LOHR, BYLINE: He's calling his announcement the Boortz happy ending. Today, comedian Jeff Foxworthy was among those who called in to lament the end of an era.\nJEFF FOXWORTHY: Man, are we going to miss you. It's just not going to be the same on the radio.\nNEAL BOORTZ: Well, you're so kind and so kind to call.\nKATHY LOHR, BYLINE: Boortz says after he retires, he plans to spend eight months on what he calls the Boortz bus traveling with his wife.\nKATHY LOHR, BYLINE: Kathy Lohr, NPR News, Atlanta.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.",

And he says he's giving up his nationally syndicated program on WSB Radio in Atlanta because it's too restrictive.\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: NPR's Kathy Lohr has the story.\nKATHY LOHR, BYLINE: Neal Boortz, who calls himself The Talkmaster, says he got off the bus in Atlanta in 1967 and did whatever he could to make a living while he was trying to get a job on the radio. He was a jewelry buyer, an insurance salesman; he loaded trucks and wrote speeches for former Georgia Governor Lester Maddox.\nNEAL BOORTZ: All this time, I'm just trying to get into radio - anything. I'll be a reporter. I'll be a cameraman for a TV station. Everybody told me, you don't have any experience. I mean, you don't know what you are doing. Get out of here.\nKATHY LOHR, BYLINE: Then a local radio host committed suicide in 1969 and Boortz says he camped out at the station early the next morning to talk to the general manager.\nNEAL BOORTZ: Well, OK, you can do it for a couple of weeks until we get a replacement in here for that show. So, they put me on that afternoon - 90 minutes. And two weeks later, they moved me to the morning show, and then that was it.\nKATHY LOHR, BYLINE: Four decades later, Boortz says he's ready to call it quits.\nNEAL BOORTZ: It's just been a total and absolute joy. Now, I'm going to miss everything associated with doing a talk radio show.\nKATHY LOHR, BYLINE: About six million listeners a week tune into the Neal Boortz Show. He's a conservative yet independent voice. Boortz is a libertarian, and during the most recent Republican campaign for president has urged his listeners not to focus on social issues, including abortion and gay marriage.

Good morning.\nSTEVE INSKEEP, host: All this year's debate and protest over immigration has left one giant question unanswered. The question is whether Congress will actually change immigration law - lawmakers are deeply divided. It is possible to imagine a compromise, as we'll here in a moment, but yesterday lawmakers put their differences on display. Senators turned up in Philadelphia to highlight the value of foreign workers, even those who came here illegally. Members of the House went to the opposite coast to make an opposing point. In San Diego, they stressed the need for tighter border security. Our coverage starts with NPR's Carrie Kahn.\nCARRIE KAHN reporting: California Congressman Ed Royce picked a San Diego border patrol station to hold his Terrorism Subcommittee hearing in hopes of drumming up public support for the House immigration bill. Royce says by building more fences and hiring thousands of agents, the border will be safer.\nRepresentative ED ROYCE (Republican, California): Immigration reform must be national security reform. Our country has made progress in fighting terrorism since 9/11, but in some areas we're losing ground, including the most fundamental task of securing our physical borders.\nKAHN: Republicans highlighted the potential for terrorists coming into the U.S. from Mexico. Sheriff Rick Flores of Webb County, Texas, testified that he and his handful of deputies are outnumbered by drug dealers and smugglers. Congressman Ted Poe of Houston asked him about even greater threats.\nRepresentative TED POE (Republican, Texas): Explain why, in your opinion, al-Qaida would set up operation in Mexico and come here.\nSheriff RICK FLORES (Webb County, Texas): Well, Mr. Poe, it's very easy for these people to go ahead and blend in in Mexico, learn the language, learn the culture, and camouflage themselves as Mexicans crossing the border.\nRepresentative TED POE (Republican, Texas): Is it your opinion that that may happen, may even actually be going on?\nSheriff RICK FLORES (Webb County, Texas): It's probably already happened.\nKAHN: House Democrats are quick to point to vulnerabilities at the Canadian border, which one Congressional study put at greater risk for terrorist incursions. And on several occasions, Democrats blamed six years of the Bush administration for failing to control the nation's borders. But Republicans pressed on. Newly elected Congressman Brian Bilbray, from San Diego, asked the local head of the border patrol why his agency can't do more to crack down on local gathering spots for illegal immigrants. Border Chief Darryl Griffen said his agents focus on the major hubs like bus stations and airports.\nChief Patrol Agent DARRYL GRIFFEN (San Diego Sector, U.S. Customs and Border Protection): That is our focus.\nRepresentative BRIAN BILBRAY (Republican, California): Chief, in my neighborhood, the Home Depot is a major hub. It's a community center.\nKAHN: The ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, Congressman Brad Sherman from Los Angeles, interrupted.\nRepresentative BRAD SHERMAN (Democrat, California): Mr. chairman, if I could just comment. Our subcommittee focuses on terrorism, and I doubt there are many terrorists at Home Depot.\nRepresentative ED ROYCE (Republican, California): We are going to now ask...\nKAHN: Chairman blasted Republicans for putting on, what he said was, a dog and pony show stacked with sympathetic witnesses. But not all of them helped the cause. Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca told lawmakers that a massive crackdown on illegal immigration might cost more than many Americans are willing to pay.\nSheriff LEE BACA (Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department, Los Angeles California): This is not an issue that can be easily dealt with with a simple solution. We don't have enough prisons in America, or enough local jails in America, to incarcerate employers and their workers combined. They're not there.\nKAHN: While opponents of illegal immigration filled the hearing room and overflowed to a tent outside, immigrant supporters gathered down the street.\nKAHN: Mariachi musicians sang of eluding the border patrol. And many spoke in support of the Senate's immigration bill, which would give millions of illegal migrants a chance at U.S. citizenship. Local labor leader, Jerry Butkiewicz, says it's time for real reform.\nMr. JERRY BUTKIEWICZ (Secretary/Treasurer, San Diego Labor Council): When people come to this country and they are willing to work hard, and they are willing to pay taxes, and they are willing to abide by our laws, they are willing to contribute to our economy, they have a right to real immigration reform. They have a right to citizenship.\nKAHN: Activists on both sides of the debate say they will follow the House Republicans to Laredo, Texas, where the next hearing is scheduled to take place tomorrow.\nKAHN: Carrie Kahn, NPR News, San Diego.",

Good morning.\nSTEVE INSKEEP, host: All this year's debate and protest over immigration has left one giant question unanswered. The question is whether Congress will actually change immigration law - lawmakers are deeply divided. It is possible to imagine a compromise, as we'll here in a moment, but yesterday lawmakers put their differences on display. Senators turned up in Philadelphia to highlight the value of foreign workers, even those who came here illegally. Members of the House went to the opposite coast to make an opposing point. In San Diego, they stressed the need for tighter border security. Our coverage starts with NPR's Carrie Kahn.\nCARRIE KAHN reporting: California Congressman Ed Royce picked a San Diego border patrol station to hold his Terrorism Subcommittee hearing in hopes of drumming up public support for the House immigration bill. Royce says by building more fences and hiring thousands of agents, the border will be safer.\nRepresentative ED ROYCE (Republican, California): Immigration reform must be national security reform. Our country has made progress in fighting terrorism since 9/11, but in some areas we're losing ground, including the most fundamental task of securing our physical borders.\nKAHN: Republicans highlighted the potential for terrorists coming into the U.S. from Mexico. Sheriff Rick Flores of Webb County, Texas, testified that he and his handful of deputies are outnumbered by drug dealers and smugglers. Congressman Ted Poe of Houston asked him about even greater threats.\nRepresentative TED POE (Republican, Texas): Explain why, in your opinion, al-Qaida would set up operation in Mexico and come here.\nSheriff RICK FLORES (Webb County, Texas): Well, Mr. Poe, it's very easy for these people to go ahead and blend in in Mexico, learn the language, learn the culture, and camouflage themselves as Mexicans crossing the border.\nRepresentative TED POE (Republican, Texas): Is it your opinion that that may happen, may even actually be going on?\nSheriff RICK FLORES (Webb County, Texas): It's probably already happened.\nKAHN: House Democrats are quick to point to vulnerabilities at the Canadian border, which one Congressional study put at greater risk for terrorist incursions. And on several occasions, Democrats blamed six years of the Bush administration for failing to control the nation's borders. But Republicans pressed on. Newly elected Congressman Brian Bilbray, from San Diego, asked the local head of the border patrol why his agency can't do more to crack down on local gathering spots for illegal immigrants. Border Chief Darryl Griffen said his agents focus on the major hubs like bus stations and airports.\nChief Patrol Agent DARRYL GRIFFEN (San Diego Sector, U.S. Customs and Border Protection): That is our focus.\nRepresentative BRIAN BILBRAY (Republican, California): Chief, in my neighborhood, the Home Depot is a major hub. It's a community center.\nKAHN: The ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, Congressman Brad Sherman from Los Angeles, interrupted.\nRepresentative BRAD SHERMAN (Democrat, California): Mr. chairman, if I could just comment. Our subcommittee focuses on terrorism, and I doubt there are many terrorists at Home Depot.\nRepresentative ED ROYCE (Republican, California): We are going to now ask...\nKAHN: Chairman blasted Republicans for putting on, what he said was, a dog and pony show stacked with sympathetic witnesses. But not all of them helped the cause. Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca told lawmakers that a massive crackdown on illegal immigration might cost more than many Americans are willing to pay.\nSheriff LEE BACA (Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department, Los Angeles California): This is not an issue that can be easily dealt with with a simple solution. We don't have enough prisons in America, or enough local jails in America, to incarcerate employers and their workers combined. They're not there.\nKAHN: While opponents of illegal immigration filled the hearing room and overflowed to a tent outside, immigrant supporters gathered down the street.\nKAHN: Mariachi musicians sang of eluding the border patrol. And many spoke in support of the Senate's immigration bill, which would give millions of illegal migrants a chance at U.S. citizenship. Local labor leader, Jerry Butkiewicz, says it's time for real reform.\nMr. JERRY BUTKIEWICZ (Secretary/Treasurer, San Diego Labor Council): When people come to this country and they are willing to work hard, and they are willing to pay taxes, and they are willing to abide by our laws, they are willing to contribute to our economy, they have a right to real immigration reform. They have a right to citizenship.\nKAHN: Activists on both sides of the debate say they will follow the House Republicans to Laredo, Texas, where the next hearing is scheduled to take place tomorrow.\nKAHN: Carrie Kahn, NPR News, San Diego.",

    "source": "ARUN RATH, HOST: Demonstrators across the nation are staging hundreds of protests against illegal immigration this weekend. They reflect a backlash against government resources going to the more than 50,000 unaccompanied minors who have crossed the southern U.S. border in recent months. This week, Los Angeles mayor, Eric Garcetti, announced he'll house some of those miners in L.A. as they await court hearings with funding from the federal government. City resources will not be used. I asked Mayor Garcetti why his city should take this on.\nMAYOR ERIC GARCETTI: Well, I think that we have always been a nation that has been defined by and that has been open to immigrants. They've been the strength of our communities. But I don't come to this from a partisan perspective. I come into this as a father and as somebody who sees kids who need to be cared for, who need to be reunified if possible and whose legal needs have to be met. I think that Los Angeles as a city of immigrants should proudly be a part of that.\nARUN RATH, HOST: Determining the final status of these children could take a while. Immigration hearings can take years to schedule. This take us sort of beyond housing to, you know, schools, health care, other services. Won't this seriously strain city resources over the long-term.\nMAYOR ERIC GARCETTI: Well, you know, Los Angeles already faces the broken immigration system and its costs when we can't award scholarships to students who are A-students and have only known the United States but might be undocumented, when we see, you know, emergency room visits and other things. There's no doubt that there's been a strain on local budgets, which is why I think we need comprehensive immigration reform. But this is a different issue here. This is an emergency situation. These are kids first and foremost. And then of course, you know, we do have to go through formal procedures on what will happen with them. I would love to see those things accelerated. I would love them to see, you know, a faster path to citizenship for people who already live here. I would love to see our borders secured, but that shouldn't keep us from action at moments of humanitarian crisis.\nARUN RATH, HOST: You mentioned that you're trying to do this in a way that does not pull resources away from other needs in the city. But you've been criticized by some homeless charities, one of whom called this a slap in the face for U.S. citizens. What do you say to them?\nMAYOR ERIC GARCETTI: Well, ironically yesterday or earlier this week, I was with First Lady Michelle Obama and announced our plans here to end veterans' homelessness and then to attack chronic homelessness here in Los Angeles. As a fellow service member, I'm appalled to see that people who would put on the uniform of this country are sleeping under our bridges, our freeway overpasses, places that they should not be.\nARUN RATH, HOST: Beyond the veterans, what about the rest of the homeless?\nMAYOR ERIC GARCETTI: So the challenge is to end veterans' homelessness by the end of 2015. And next after that, I'll be looking at the chronic homeless population, which we've already made some dents in. I'm looking to the state and federal government, which have cut our housing dollars in recent years, to re-up those as well as for us to locally generate a consistent source of funding to build permanent, supportive housing that won't just get people off the street, but give them the services that they need to stay in those apartments and to stay permanently in housing and to get employed. So we're looking at this in a holistic way so we don't throw money at a problem and people wind up back on the street.\nARUN RATH, HOST: You said that you're not trying to do this in a partisan way, but as you know, all of this debate has been very politically fraught. And there would be a cynical take that, you know, being in Los Angeles, being in California, it's politically safer for you to make this kind of move than it might be in other places.\nMAYOR ERIC GARCETTI: Well, you know, I'm only moved by my conscience and by good management. I'm in charge of running a city. I'm a CEO of a great American city of 4 million people. And I have to do what works. We don't have time to engage in partisan politics. A pothole isn't Republican or Democratic. We have problems to solve. And we certainly see part of our future success as a nation and certainly as a city as being tied to the world. And certainly that's where the investment, jobs and prosperity will come from in the future. That's why I'm so focused on this as a mayor.\nARUN RATH, HOST: Mayor, what would be your message to potential immigrants or those who are considering potentially risking their children's lives to get them to this country?\nMAYOR ERIC GARCETTI: Well, I don't think - the system that we have, it's very wise. And for me, the reason that I'm reaching out is we have children that are here. But I certainly wouldn't encourage people to send their children or for children to cross the border. That's an incredibly dangerous journey. And I'd want people to hear that loud and clear. But just as loud and clear, I think we have an obligation, once we suddenly have children that are in our country here, to be caring about them while we determine their final status.\nARUN RATH, HOST: Los Angeles mayor, Eric Garcetti, joined me from his office in City Hall.

    "source": "ARUN RATH, HOST: Demonstrators across the nation are staging hundreds of protests against illegal immigration this weekend. They reflect a backlash against government resources going to the more than 50,000 unaccompanied minors who have crossed the southern U.S. border in recent months. This week, Los Angeles mayor, Eric Garcetti, announced he'll house some of those miners in L.A. as they await court hearings with funding from the federal government. City resources will not be used. I asked Mayor Garcetti why his city should take this on.\nMAYOR ERIC GARCETTI: Well, I think that we have always been a nation that has been defined by and that has been open to immigrants. They've been the strength of our communities. But I don't come to this from a partisan perspective. I come into this as a father and as somebody who sees kids who need to be cared for, who need to be reunified if possible and whose legal needs have to be met. I think that Los Angeles as a city of immigrants should proudly be a part of that.\nARUN RATH, HOST: Determining the final status of these children could take a while. Immigration hearings can take years to schedule. This take us sort of beyond housing to, you know, schools, health care, other services. Won't this seriously strain city resources over the long-term.\nMAYOR ERIC GARCETTI: Well, you know, Los Angeles already faces the broken immigration system and its costs when we can't award scholarships to students who are A-students and have only known the United States but might be undocumented, when we see, you know, emergency room visits and other things. There's no doubt that there's been a strain on local budgets, which is why I think we need comprehensive immigration reform. But this is a different issue here. This is an emergency situation. These are kids first and foremost. And then of course, you know, we do have to go through formal procedures on what will happen with them. I would love to see those things accelerated. I would love them to see, you know, a faster path to citizenship for people who already live here. I would love to see our borders secured, but that shouldn't keep us from action at moments of humanitarian crisis.\nARUN RATH, HOST: You mentioned that you're trying to do this in a way that does not pull resources away from other needs in the city. But you've been criticized by some homeless charities, one of whom called this a slap in the face for U.S. citizens. What do you say to them?\nMAYOR ERIC GARCETTI: Well, ironically yesterday or earlier this week, I was with First Lady Michelle Obama and announced our plans here to end veterans' homelessness and then to attack chronic homelessness here in Los Angeles. As a fellow service member, I'm appalled to see that people who would put on the uniform of this country are sleeping under our bridges, our freeway overpasses, places that they should not be.\nARUN RATH, HOST: Beyond the veterans, what about the rest of the homeless?\nMAYOR ERIC GARCETTI: So the challenge is to end veterans' homelessness by the end of 2015. And next after that, I'll be looking at the chronic homeless population, which we've already made some dents in. I'm looking to the state and federal government, which have cut our housing dollars in recent years, to re-up those as well as for us to locally generate a consistent source of funding to build permanent, supportive housing that won't just get people off the street, but give them the services that they need to stay in those apartments and to stay permanently in housing and to get employed. So we're looking at this in a holistic way so we don't throw money at a problem and people wind up back on the street.\nARUN RATH, HOST: You said that you're not trying to do this in a partisan way, but as you know, all of this debate has been very politically fraught. And there would be a cynical take that, you know, being in Los Angeles, being in California, it's politically safer for you to make this kind of move than it might be in other places.\nMAYOR ERIC GARCETTI: Well, you know, I'm only moved by my conscience and by good management. I'm in charge of running a city. I'm a CEO of a great American city of 4 million people. And I have to do what works. We don't have time to engage in partisan politics. A pothole isn't Republican or Democratic. We have problems to solve. And we certainly see part of our future success as a nation and certainly as a city as being tied to the world. And certainly that's where the investment, jobs and prosperity will come from in the future. That's why I'm so focused on this as a mayor.\nARUN RATH, HOST: Mayor, what would be your message to potential immigrants or those who are considering potentially risking their children's lives to get them to this country?\nMAYOR ERIC GARCETTI: Well, I don't think - the system that we have, it's very wise.

I'm Michele Norris.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: And I'm Melissa Block.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: President Obama is looking for ways to cut the budget. Yesterday, his former rival for the presidency, Senator John McCain, suggested he look no further than the White House lawn.\nMICHELE NORRIS, Host: Your helicopter is now going to cost as much as Air Force One. I don't think that there's any more graphic demonstration of how good ideas have cost taxpayers enormous amount of money.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: And the president didn't disagree.\nP: The helicopter I have now seems perfectly adequate to me.\nP: Of course, I've never had a helicopter before.\nP: You know, maybe I've been deprived, and I didn't know it. But I think it is an example of the procurement process gone amuck.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: And joining us to talk about this pricey helicopter is Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman. Tom, what's the history here?\nTOM BOWMAN: Well, this all started after the September 11th attacks. White House officials went to the Pentagon and said, listen, the president needs a better helicopter, one that can protect him in a better way, and also one where he can have better communications, talk with anyone in the world from his helicopter.\nTOM BOWMAN: And also, the current fleet is almost 40 years old, started flying during Gerald Ford's administration back in the mid-'70s, and they are getting to the end of their lifespan. They're looking at 2017, and that will be the end of these helicopters.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: What else do they want this new helicopter to do?\nTOM BOWMAN: Well, I just talked with Loren Thompson. He's a defense analyst. He knows a lot about this program. And here's his list of what they want it to have.\nD: Many of the things that are carried on the presidential helicopter are secret. However, what we do know is that it has extensive self-protection capabilities against surface-to-air missiles; that it has hundreds of pounds of very secret communications equipment so the president can stay in touch with foreign leaders where there's nuclear forces and so on; that it has a kitchen, it has a bathroom, it has seating for 14 people, and it has a multiperson crew.\nTOM BOWMAN: Now, it also has to be small enough to land in that tight confinement of the White House grounds. And the other thing, they want it to go farther. The current helicopter goes maybe 150 miles before it has to refuel. This one, they want to go 300 miles in the event of a nuclear attack.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: And meantime, this helicopter - fleet of helicopters is over budget and overdue.\nTOM BOWMAN: That's right. What happened is they kept adding requirements to it. They want it to be able to prevent a missile attack, better communications and so forth. Even the seats had to be able to take nine G's in case it drops out of the sky, and it can protect people. And they've built five of these already, and the next line of 23 will have an even more equipment. And there's talk about adding a new engine to compensate for the added weight.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: Why do they need 28?\nTOM BOWMAN: It's not only the president who will use these but also the vice president, some of the top leaders, Defense Secretary Gates, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. And also, when the president goes around the country or overseas, they'll bring the helicopter along with him.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: Now, when Senator John McCain says this is more expensive than Air Force One, is he right?\nTOM BOWMAN: Well, he is. In 1990, when they procured the two Air Force One planes, it was a total cost of $650 million, so roughly $325 million each. But a better comparison might be the F22 fighter, the Air Force's most sophisticated jet, and that cost roughly the same as one of these helicopters - around $400 million.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: Well, what happens now? And Barack Obama said this is a procurement process run amock. Do they scrap it? What do they do?\nTOM BOWMAN: Well, it's a good question. Now, they have five now in flight testing. And they said Obama or someone else might be able to fly this in the next year and a half or so. So the question is, will they build the additional 23 with this added equipment? We don't know the answer to that yet. But the one thing we do know is the current fleet of helicopters is getting old, and they need some replacement.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: Okay.

And Barack Obama said this is a procurement process run amock. Do they scrap it? What do they do?\\nTOM BOWMAN: Well, it's a good question. Now, they have five now in flight testing. And they said Obama or someone else might be able to fly this in the next year and a half or so. So the question is, will they build the additional 23 with this added equipment? We don't know the answer to that yet. But the one thing we do know is the current fleet of helicopters is getting old, and they need some replacement.\\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: Okay.

I'm Michele Norris.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: And I'm Melissa Block.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: President Obama is looking for ways to cut the budget. Yesterday, his former rival for the presidency, Senator John McCain, suggested he look no further than the White House lawn.\nMICHELE NORRIS, Host: Your helicopter is now going to cost as much as Air Force One. I don't think that there's any more graphic demonstration of how good ideas have cost taxpayers enormous amount of money.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: And the president didn't disagree.\nP: The helicopter I have now seems perfectly adequate to me.\nP: Of course, I've never had a helicopter before.\nP: You know, maybe I've been deprived, and I didn't know it. But I think it is an example of the procurement process gone amuck.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: And joining us to talk about this pricey helicopter is Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman. Tom, what's the history here?\nTOM BOWMAN: Well, this all started after the September 11th attacks. White House officials went to the Pentagon and said, listen, the president needs a better helicopter, one that can protect him in a better way, and also one where he can have better communications, talk with anyone in the world from his helicopter.\nTOM BOWMAN: And also, the current fleet is almost 40 years old, started flying during Gerald Ford's administration back in the mid-'70s, and they are getting to the end of their lifespan. They're looking at 2017, and that will be the end of these helicopters.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: What else do they want this new helicopter to do?\nTOM BOWMAN: Well, I just talked with Loren Thompson. He's a defense analyst. He knows a lot about this program. And here's his list of what they want it to have.\nD: Many of the things that are carried on the presidential helicopter are secret. However, what we do know is that it has extensive self-protection capabilities against surface-to-air missiles; that it has hundreds of pounds of very secret communications equipment so the president can stay in touch with foreign leaders where there's nuclear forces and so on; that it has a kitchen, it has a bathroom, it has seating for 14 people, and it has a multiperson crew.\nTOM BOWMAN: Now, it also has to be small enough to land in that tight confinement of the White House grounds. And the other thing, they want it to go farther. The current helicopter goes maybe 150 miles before it has to refuel. This one, they want to go 300 miles in the event of a nuclear attack.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: And meantime, this helicopter - fleet of helicopters is over budget and overdue.\nTOM BOWMAN: That's right. What happened is they kept adding requirements to it. They want it to be able to prevent a missile attack, better communications and so forth. Even the seats had to be able to take nine G's in case it drops out of the sky, and it can protect people. And they've built five of these already, and the next line of 23 will have an even more equipment. And there's talk about adding a new engine to compensate for the added weight.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: Why do they need 28?\nTOM BOWMAN: It's not only the president who will use these but also the vice president, some of the top leaders, Defense Secretary Gates, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. And also, when the president goes around the country or overseas, they'll bring the helicopter along with him.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: Now, when Senator John McCain says this is more expensive than Air Force One, is he right?\nTOM BOWMAN: Well, he is. In 1990, when they procured the two Air Force One planes, it was a total cost of $650 million, so roughly $325 million each. But a better comparison might be the F22 fighter, the Air Force's most sophisticated jet, and that cost roughly the same as one of these helicopters - around $400 million.\nMELISSA BLOCK, Host: Well, what happens now?

The alleged shooter had numerous posts on social media trafficking in conspiracy theories about prominent Jewish figures. And according to law enforcement, he shouted anti-Semitic slurs when he opened fire on the congregation. And while this might be the deadliest attack on a Jewish target, it is not the only recent one. According to our next guest, anti-Semitic attacks have spiked over the past two years. George Selim is senior vice president for programs with the Anti-Defamation League. Thank you so much for joining us in the studio today.\nGEORGE SELIM: Good morning, Lulu. Thanks for having me.\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: First, my condolences.\nGEORGE SELIM: Thank you.\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: This is an incredibly painful moment, I know, for the community. Can you tell me your thoughts about what happened?\nGEORGE SELIM: Yeah. And just before I do that, I just want to express the most heartfelt and sincere condolences to the Jewish community, not just in the greater Pittsburgh area but really across the globe that is collectively mourning and suffering this morning.\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: Of course - so what is your reaction to this?\nGEORGE SELIM: So what we see here is really the result of a very tragic and unfortunate pattern and trend of the rise of extremism and anti-Semitism over the past several years. In calendar year 2017, we saw the largest single increase of anti-Semitic incidents in recent times. We saw nearly a 60 percent increase in anti-Semitic incidents in 2017 over the previous year, 2016. In addition, we saw nearly a 90 percent increase in anti-Semitic incidents in K-12 classrooms in schools across the United States.\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: Before we get to why you think this is happening, when you say anti-Semitic incidents, what are you discussing?\nGEORGE SELIM: When we're talking about an anti-Semitic incident at a school, in a classroom, in a K-12, it's everything from the scrawling of a swastika on a bathroom wall to instances in - most recently in a Western state, where a student made very callous and cold references related to the death of Jews in the Holocaust as part of a Valentine's Day project. And so it really takes all different shapes and forms. Just three weeks ago here in Northern Virginia, I was at the Jewish Community Center in Fairfax where 19 swastikas were spray-painted on the side of, really, a community center where people come to exercise and hold community-based events. So it really takes all forms.\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: Why do you think this is happening now?\nGEORGE SELIM: I think a couple things. In recent years, there has been a normalization of hate and extremism both online and offline. The normalization of rhetoric and - from the highest levels of retweets of individuals like David Duke, from posts and restatements that are associated with white nationalists in this country - has almost become normal or part of a global discourse. In addition to that, the political divide in this country has become so toxic and, when combined with the normalization of this type of hate speech and anti-Semitism, has really led to a volatile atmosphere that we've seen play out just in the past week.\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: Also this week, a bomb was delivered to the home of George Soros, who is also Jewish. We've seen a lot of trafficking of conspiracy theories about him on mainstream conservative TV news, like Fox, even.\nGEORGE SELIM: Correct - and, in fact, ADL recently released some reporting that goes back and tracks a lot of the conspiracy theories. And they have their roots in anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, as well. This is something that we've unfortunately seen play out both in the offline and online spaces. Some of the most vitriolic anti-Semitic attacks against Soros and others have really come out in the past year or two. And it's something that the ADL will remain constant and vigilant in combating on a day in and day out basis.\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: We should also say this shooter was also trafficking in these conspiracy theories. He apparently believed that the caravan coming from Central America, which has been repeatedly discussed by the president and others, was being sponsored by Jewish organizations.\nGEORGE SELIM: Correct. One of the Jewish organizations that was mentioned in some of his posts was HIAS, an organization that does tremendous work on refugees and asylees, as well as the Anti-Defamation League. I mean, there were several posts and comments in his open-source social media. There were many victims in this case that were in Pittsburgh and beyond. And it's up to us as a global community of citizens and organizations to remain vigilant and push back against all forms of anti-Semitism, discrimination and bigotry. And we're committed to doing so.\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: George Selim, senior vice president for programs of the Anti-Defamation League, thank you so much for coming in.\nGEORGE SELIM: Thank you.",

And while this might be the deadliest attack on a Jewish target, it is not the only recent one. According to our next guest, anti-Semitic attacks have spiked over the past two years. George Selim is senior vice president for programs with the Anti-Defamation League. Thank you so much for joining us in the studio today.\nGEORGE SELIM: Good morning, Lulu. Thanks for having me.\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: First, my condolences.\nGEORGE SELIM: Thank you.\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: This is an incredibly painful moment, I know, for the community. Can you tell me your thoughts about what happened?\nGEORGE SELIM: Yeah. And just before I do that, I just want to express the most heartfelt and sincere condolences to the Jewish community, not just in the greater Pittsburgh area but really across the globe that is collectively mourning and suffering this morning.\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: Of course - so what is your reaction to this?\nGEORGE SELIM: So what we see here is really the result of a very tragic and unfortunate pattern and trend of the rise of extremism and anti-Semitism over the past several years. In calendar year 2017, we saw the largest single increase of anti-Semitic incidents in recent times. We saw nearly a 60 percent increase in anti-Semitic incidents in 2017 over the previous year, 2016. In addition, we saw nearly a 90 percent increase in anti-Semitic incidents in K-12 classrooms in schools across the United States.\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: Before we get to why you think this is happening, when you say anti-Semitic incidents, what are you discussing?\nGEORGE SELIM: When we're talking about an anti-Semitic incident at a school, in a classroom, in a K-12, it's everything from the scrawling of a swastika on a bathroom wall to instances in - most recently in a Western state, where a student made very callous and cold references related to the death of Jews in the Holocaust as part of a Valentine's Day project. And so it really takes all different shapes and forms. Just three weeks ago here in Northern Virginia, I was at the Jewish Community Center in Fairfax where 19 swastikas were spray-painted on the side of, really, a community center where people come to exercise and hold community-based events. So it really takes all forms.\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: Why do you think this is happening now?\nGEORGE SELIM: I think a couple things. In recent years, there has been a normalization of hate and extremism both online and offline. The normalization of rhetoric and - from the highest levels of retweets of individuals like David Duke, from posts and restatements that are associated with white nationalists in this country - has almost become normal or part of a global discourse. In addition to that, the political divide in this country has become so toxic and, when combined with the normalization of this type of hate speech and anti-Semitism, has really led to a volatile atmosphere that we've seen play out just in the past week.\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: Also this week, a bomb was delivered to the home of George Soros, who is also Jewish. We've seen a lot of trafficking of conspiracy theories about him on mainstream conservative TV news, like Fox, even.\nGEORGE SELIM: Correct - and, in fact, ADL recently released some reporting that goes back and tracks a lot of the conspiracy theories. And they have their roots in anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, as well. This is something that we've unfortunately seen play out both in the offline and online spaces. Some of the most vitriolic anti-Semitic attacks against Soros and others have really come out in the past year or two. And it's something that the ADL will remain constant and vigilant in combating on a day in and day out basis.\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: We should also say this shooter was also trafficking in these conspiracy theories.

    "source": "DAVID GREENE, HOST: This weekend thousands of hackers will converge on Las Vegas to try their hand at breaking into, well, all sorts of stuff - medical devices, cars and even voting equipment. They're being encouraged to do this in hopes of finding vulnerabilities ahead of the 2020 election. Joining us from Las Vegas, site of the Def Con hacking conference, is NPR's Miles Parks who covers election security. Hi there, Miles.\nMILES PARKS, BYLINE: Hi, David.\nDAVID GREENE, HOST: Well, so how important is this in terms of election security, getting people to try and break into voting systems so you can really understand what's vulnerable and what's not?\nMILES PARKS, BYLINE: Well, it's really important, especially when you consider the context of how voting officials have viewed this sort of behavior in the past. I mean, we're only just a couple years removed from election supervisors, people in Congress casting doubt on whether Russia was - Russian attackers were able to break into any sort of voting equipment at all and then, more broadly, whether the equipment that we were using to vote to register was vulnerable.\nMILES PARKS, BYLINE: So we're past that point. You know, there's pretty broad consensus that this issue - cybersecurity in voting - is something worth talking about. You know, the Senate intelligence committee released a report about Russian interference a couple weeks ago, and they cited work that was found at this conference last year. And then this weekend, a U.S. Senator, Ron Wyden from Oregon, is actually going to be giving the keynote address. So this has gone pretty mainstream at this point.\nDAVID GREENE, HOST: OK, a lot of confidence that they can learn a lot of important stuff there. So how does it actually work? I mean, what do you actually watch as you're at this conference?\nMILES PARKS, BYLINE: So let me set the stage here. Going back to just how our voting system works - right? - private companies, not government officials are actually overseeing the equipment that we use to vote, whether it's websites, the actual voting equipment, the registration equipment. And they don't allow anyone behind the scenes to poke around and see what's actually going on. And not just, like, you or me - I'm talking about the government officials who are actually contracting these companies out. They don't even let those people look at it and confirm the security of the equipment.\nMILES PARKS, BYLINE: So this weekend is the time for that poking around to happen. So there is going to be thousands of people poking around equipment that was purchased on eBay, purchased at government auctions to either take a shot at messing with the equipment or to take notes on the people taking a shot and messing with the equipment.\nMILES PARKS, BYLINE: And these people, David, they're really good. I've been warned by multiple people I need to have my cellphone off when I'm walking around here because there's going to be hackers who are going to be in the public Wi-Fi trying to get into whatever equipment they can.\nDAVID GREENE, HOST: Oh, wow. OK, keep your phone off, Miles. So there's been so much scrutiny of 2016 and what happened. I mean, do people feel like things have improved since then as we start heading into 2020 with the potential for more cyberattacks?\nMILES PARKS, BYLINE: There's no question that things have definitely gotten better. Federal resources are on a completely different level in terms of communicating about this subject. But the actual equipment we're going to be using to vote will be largely the same. On a whole, no one I've talked to was - has been willing this week to say that they don't think there won't be cyberattacks in the future. I talked to Amit Yoran. He's the CEO of a cybersecurity company called Tenable. And he's also a former DHS cyber official.\nAMIT YORAN: Just when you think it couldn't get worse, there's always a creative, innovative, manipulative influence. And this is very much a cat and mouse game.\nMILES PARKS, BYLINE: So it's important, right here, to say that there's no evidence that any votes, even in 2016 when we saw those cyberattacks into a voter registration system in Illinois, for instance - no - we have no evidence that any votes or any voting data was changed. But as we'll see this weekend, there are still vulnerabilities in a lot of different aspects of this system.\nDAVID GREENE, HOST: NPR's Miles Parks in Las Vegas.

Hi there, Miles.\nMILES PARKS, BYLINE: Hi, David.\nDAVID GREENE, HOST: Well, so how important is this in terms of election security, getting people to try and break into voting systems so you can really understand what's vulnerable and what's not?\nMILES PARKS, BYLINE: Well, it's really important, especially when you consider the context of how voting officials have viewed this sort of behavior in the past. I mean, we're only just a couple years removed from election supervisors, people in Congress casting doubt on whether Russia was - Russian attackers were able to break into any sort of voting equipment at all and then, more broadly, whether the equipment that we were using to vote to register was vulnerable.\nMILES PARKS, BYLINE: So we're past that point. You know, there's pretty broad consensus that this issue - cybersecurity in voting - is something worth talking about. You know, the Senate intelligence committee released a report about Russian interference a couple weeks ago, and they cited work that was found at this conference last year. And then this weekend, a U.S. Senator, Ron Wyden from Oregon, is actually going to be giving the keynote address. So this has gone pretty mainstream at this point.\nDAVID GREENE, HOST: OK, a lot of confidence that they can learn a lot of important stuff there. So how does it actually work? I mean, what do you actually watch as you're at this conference?\nMILES PARKS, BYLINE: So let me set the stage here. Going back to just how our voting system works - right? - private companies, not government officials are actually overseeing the equipment that we use to vote, whether it's websites, the actual voting equipment, the registration equipment. And they don't allow anyone behind the scenes to poke around and see what's actually going on. And not just, like, you or me - I'm talking about the government officials who are actually contracting these companies out. They don't even let those people look at it and confirm the security of the equipment.\nMILES PARKS, BYLINE: So this weekend is the time for that poking around to happen. So there is going to be thousands of people poking around equipment that was purchased on eBay, purchased at government auctions to either take a shot at messing with the equipment or to take notes on the people taking a shot and messing with the equipment.\nMILES PARKS, BYLINE: And these people, David, they're really good. I've been warned by multiple people I need to have my cellphone off when I'm walking around here because there's going to be hackers who are going to be in the public Wi-Fi trying to get into whatever equipment they can.\nDAVID GREENE, HOST: Oh, wow. OK, keep your phone off, Miles. So there's been so much scrutiny of 2016 and what happened. I mean, do people feel like things have improved since then as we start heading into 2020 with the potential for more cyberattacks?\nMILES PARKS, BYLINE: There's no question that things have definitely gotten better. Federal resources are on a completely different level in terms of communicating about this subject. But the actual equipment we're going to be using to vote will be largely the same. On a whole, no one I've talked to was - has been willing this week to say that they don't think there won't be cyberattacks in the future. I talked to Amit Yoran. He's the CEO of a cybersecurity company called Tenable. And he's also a former DHS cyber official.\nAMIT YORAN: Just when you think it couldn't get worse, there's always a creative, innovative, manipulative influence. And this is very much a cat and mouse game.\nMILES PARKS, BYLINE: So it's important, right here, to say that there's no evidence that any votes, even in 2016 when we saw those cyberattacks into a voter registration system in Illinois, for instance - no - we have no evidence that any votes or any voting data was changed. But as we'll see this weekend, there are still vulnerabilities in a lot of different aspects of this system.\nDAVID GREENE, HOST: NPR's Miles Parks in Las Vegas. Thanks, Miles.\nMILES PARKS, BYLINE: Thank you, David.",

We'll take a closer look at what he's expected to say. And Saddam Hussein's new book. That's right. On the eve of the U.S.-led invasion he was supposedly finishing his novel. We have the story.

Thousands of students failed the test even though they were tested only on eighth grade math comprehension, ninth and 10th grade level English. California sued by students, 10 of them, who failed the exam. Today's ruling could potentially allow thousands of students who didn't pass that test to graduate.

        "\"DOBBS: Coming up at the top of the hour here on CNN, \\\"THE SITUATION ROOM\\\" with Wolf Blitzer. Here's Wolf -- Wolf.\\nWOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: Thanks very much, Lou. Poker, hookers and the CIA? Police search the home of the man who was the third in charge over at the Central Intelligence Agency. It's a very complicated story, but we are going to sort it out for you tonight. Also, President Bush's immigration plan, he's planning, as you know, a prime time address on Monday night. We'll take a closer look at what he's expected to say. And Saddam Hussein's new book. That's right. On the eve of the U.S.-led invasion he was supposedly finishing his novel. We have the story. And Bush versus Clinton, how does the current president stack up against the previous one? We hit the streets to find out. We've got some new poll numbers on that. Lots more coming up, Lou, at the top of the hour.\\nDOBBS: Looking forward to it. Thank you, Wolf. An update tonight on the story we reported here last night. A judge in California issuing a temporary injunction tonight against California's new high school exit exam. Thousands of students failed the test even though they were tested only on eighth grade math comprehension, ninth and 10th grade level English. California sued by students, 10 of them, who failed the exam. Today's ruling could potentially allow thousands of students who didn't pass that test to graduate.

Fuld testified on the Hill trying to explain the bank's demise and his $480 million earnings over the past eight years. Unlike Lehman, AIG got a government bailout. AIG execs spent more than $300,000 for a weekend retreat less than one week after the government gave the company $85 billion. And the big three with the CEOs of Ford, GM and Chrysler came to Washington hat in hand asking for a bailout. They did it in style.

That wall of shame was a good thing because, you know, it's power to the people time. And the battle that pitted Main Street versus Wall Street, Main Street now has the upper hand. Really? Shame works.\nCOSTELLO (voice-over): Forget about Congress re-regulating Wall Street. Turns out a little public flogging is pretty darn effective. Shame works. From public demonstrations --\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think it's disgusting.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's all toxic.\nCOSTELLO: To scathing public indictments.\nCAMPBELL BROWN, CNN ANCHOR: Who is in charge of this process? Who is watching the banks? Who is demanding accountability?\nCOSTELLO: Right now, it's you, Main Street. When word got out ex- Merrill Lynch boss John Thain spent $1.2 million to renovate his office, public outrage was so extreme, even the man who thought it was OK to pay $35,000 for a toilet finally got it.\nJOHN THAIN, FMR. CEO, MERRILL LYNCH: It is clear to me, in today's world, that it was a mistake. I apologize for spending that money on those -- on those things. And I will make it right. I will reimburse the company for all of those costs.\nCOSTELLO: And he didn't even have to be publicly berated by Congress as so many others have, like ex-Countrywide CEO Angelo Mozilo whose company sunk in the subprime mess and cost taxpayers millions in bailout money.\nANGELO MOZILO, CEO COUNTRYWIDE FINANCIAL: I waive any and all severance, in addition canceled the consulting agreement included in my contract.\nCOSTELLO: Public advocacy groups feel positively vindicated.\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Totally. I mean, well, but we have before. This is not the first time. But we do feel vindicated.\nCOSTELLO: Keep in mind these failed CEOs don't legally have to give up their cushy perks even if their companies benefit from the $700 billion bailout. But some experts say shame is proving to be a most effective weapon.\nBRAD GOOGINS, BOSTON COLLEGE CTR. FOR CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP: Change really happens from the inside out, in any institution, whether it's the churches or corporations or whatever.

        "\"ROBERTS: Welcome back to the \\\"Most News in the Morning.\\\" As the economy crumbles, it is taking some people along with it. Here's a look at some members of the financial meltdown hall of shame. One of the first banks to tumble was Lehman Brothers, and along with it -- Lehman Brothers, rather, along with it CEO Dick Fuld. Fuld testified on the Hill trying to explain the bank's demise and his $480 million earnings over the past eight years. Unlike Lehman, AIG got a government bailout. AIG execs spent more than $300,000 for a weekend retreat less than one week after the government gave the company $85 billion. And the big three with the CEOs of Ford, GM and Chrysler came to Washington hat in hand asking for a bailout. They did it in style. Each flew in on his own jet and took a beating for it on Capitol Hill, so much so that the next time they arrived, a couple of them were in hybrids, another one in a very high-mileage cars. So they got the message.\\nCHETRY: Well, they're cutting checks with your money, bonuses in the billions, millions for stuff they don't need. When is the pushback going to happen? Well, maybe it's already started. Carol Costello joins us live from Washington. Hi, Carol.\\nCAROL COSTELLO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Kiran. I'm looking at the glass half full this morning. That wall of shame was a good thing because, you know, it's power to the people time. And the battle that pitted Main Street versus Wall Street, Main Street now has the upper hand. Really? Shame works.\\nCOSTELLO (voice-over): Forget about Congress re-regulating Wall Street. Turns out a little public flogging is pretty darn effective. Shame works. From public demonstrations --\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think it's disgusting.\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's all toxic.\\nCOSTELLO: To scathing public indictments.\\nCAMPBELL BROWN, CNN ANCHOR: Who is in charge of this process?

In a statement today, the organization says the decision to continue to exclude gays, quote, \"remains in the best interest of scouting.\" The boy scouts conducted a two-year review of the ban. The group has faced numerous protests over this policy. NASA's latest rover is in for a rocky landing on Mars in the coming weeks. NASA officials call it 7 minutes of terror because the landing is so complicated. The curiosity rover is about the size of a small SUV.

When residents weren't happy with the options, he knows what he likes including drinking water from a wine glass with catnip. And his popular with the town's 800 residents and he even has his own Facebook page. Somehow I would guess he probably has a Twitter account as well and probably a number of followers, too, Wolf.\\nBLITZER: Very high-tech cat indeed. Thanks, Lisa, for that. During the Arab uprisings, thousands of lives were put on hold to join protests and Olympic athletes were no exception. Many of them had to stop training, others suffered injuries and some even lost family members. CNN's Mohamed Jamjoom has the story of Tunisian gymnast who was told by the former regimen he would never compete again.\\nMOHAMMED JAMJOOM, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Wajdi Bouallegue's finally getting the global recognition he deserves. A major photo shoot for \\\"Sports Illustrated\\\" and what has become one of the symbols of the revolution. This is the former home of the toppled Tunisian president's brother- in-law. After he fled the country it was gutted and covered in graffiti. Now it houses rubble and revolutionary art. For Tunisia's star gymnast and Olympic hopeful, it's a strong statement. Bouallegue's one of Tunisia's leading athletes, known to be one of the best floor exercise performers in African and Arab history. He makes the sport look easy combining physical strength, poise, flexibility and balance. He competed in the 2004 Olympics and now set to be the only Tunisian gymnast at the 2012 games. During Tunisia's revolution, the scenes of protest not only took over his athletic dreams, the violence hit home.\\nWAJDI BOUALLEGUE, TUNISIAN GYMNAST: I was here downstairs with all the neighbors here ready to protect our city.\\nJAMJOOM: Bouallegue decided to defend his community during the uprising as part of a neighborhood watch. (on camera): So this is where you guys would sort of patrol?\\nBOUALLEGUE: Yes. This is where every residence over here have their own groups and every head of family right here of every home. And our wives and our sons are at home and right here to communicate with us if there is something wrong happening we communicate quickly. We were really scared. Sometimes we was like 200, 300 people. Then we just heard some noise like, come on, come on, go to fight, go to fight and we run, we run, we run.\\nBLITZER: That report from CNN's Mohamed Jamjoom. Coming up, President Bill Clinton, he is visiting Nelson Mandela on the eve of his 94th birthday. In our brand new 6:00 p.m. Eastern hour of THE SITUATION ROOM, President Clinton sits down with CNN in South Africa. You're going to hear what he has to say, what he's learned from the South African leader and more. The interview with Bill Clinton in the 6:00 p.m. Eastern hour. Also, there were heated President Obama's victory in 2008, but what will the president need to do to get young voters really excited this time around?\""

But they only last a couple of weeks whereas the political Olympics here in the United States pitting Mitt Romney against President Obama will last all summer and then go into the fall. The competition I must say is already in full swing. CNN's John Berman is joining us now to take a closer look at what's going on. John, the events -- are the candidates competing in -- what are these events? Give us a little sense.\nJOHN BERMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You know, Wolf, both President Obama and Mitt Romney are very fit, which is a good thing because when you think about it, our candidates today are like modern day decathlon athletes. They have to do it all and in a way they're events are harder because only the gold medal counts.\nBERMAN (voice-over): Sadly, the 2012 games do not feature golf or jet skiing as official events. So neither President Obama nor Mitt Romney will compete in London. But that doesn't mean they don't have their own games. No. They have the political Olympics. Take the hurdles. Mitt Romney had to leap over his GOP foes just to get here. You think jumping over Cain, Perry and Gingrich was easy? Just ask Rick Santorum. He ended up with the silver.\nRICK SANTORUM (R), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We will suspend our campaign effective today.\nBERMAN: Pole vault, the latest \"Wall Street Journal\"/NBC poll showed the president vaulting to a six-point lead. Synchronized diving even without the Speedos, both campaigns medal in endless precision repetition.\nMITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Middle class.\nBARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: The middle class.\nROMNEY: Create jobs.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Create jobs.\nBERMAN: While we're in the pool, a politician's least favorite event, the backstroke. Former New Hampshire Governor John Sununu just visited the podium after saying the president need to learn how to be an American. Check out his backstroke.\nJOHN SUNUNU, FORMER NEW HAMPSHIRE GOVERNOR: Frankly, I made a mistake. I shouldn't have used those words and I apologize for using those words.\nBERMAN: Weight lifting, Mitt Romney better have big arms to lift the bags of money his campaign has raked in. Finally, if there's one Olympic sport our leaders know all too well, it's gymnastics. Not all of them can handle the flips. This was Gary Bower in 2000. But today's crop is adept at the verbal gymnastics, the contortions, turns and, yes, the twists.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: He's been twisting my words around to suggest that I don't value small business.\nROMNEY: Their opposition people look for anything they can find to distort, to twist and try and make negative.\nBERMAN: With all that twisting, let's get these guys on the balance beam. Meanwhile, we can only hope they don't discover beach volleyball. America couldn't bear the outfits.\nBERMAN: You know, it's also a good thing it's not winter or we would be talking about ice dancing. Now, in terms of what the candidates will be watching, we know President Obama met with the men's basketball team. We know he's a big fan of theirs. And Mitt Romney says he hopes to check out some swimming before he leaves London. And you could say he's already been working on his backstroke after this kerfuffle over the whole U.S./London ready thing -- Wolf.\nBLITZER: Who writes that material? Do you write all that yourself, John?\nBERMAN: I have a staff of thousands.\nBLITZER: That's terrific writing.\nBERMAN: Thank you. I appreciate that very much.\nBLITZER: Great stuff. John Berman, excellent work. I loved it. All right, thanks so much. Important note to all of our viewers, you can catch John along with Zoraida Sambolin every morning on \"EARLY START\" right here at CNN. That \"EARLY START\" starts at 5:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. Eastern only on CNN. Get up early even if you don't check it out. I think you'll like it. Mitt Romney himself is making the political Olympic analogy touting his experience organizing the Salt Lake City winter games in 2002. Listen to what he tells CNN's Piers Morgan in an interview in London that will air later tonight.\nROMNEY: The country is in need of a turnaround. The Olympics was a turnaround for businesses I've been associated with that needed a turnaround. That kind of experience of focusing on the most critical issue, building the most effective team possible, creating a common vision, unifying around that vision and then delivering results is something I think the American people would like to see in our economy right now.\nBLITZER: Once again that interview with Romney on \"PIERS MORGAN TONIGHT\" at 9:00 p.m. Eastern. All right, let's talk a little bit about that and more in our \"Strategy Session\" joining us our CNN political contributor, the Democratic strategist Donna Brazile and our CNN contributor, Ana Navarro.

They have to do it all and in a way they're events are harder because only the gold medal counts.\\nBERMAN (voice-over): Sadly, the 2012 games do not feature golf or jet skiing as official events. So neither President Obama nor Mitt Romney will compete in London. But that doesn't mean they don't have their own games. No. They have the political Olympics. Take the hurdles. Mitt Romney had to leap over his GOP foes just to get here. You think jumping over Cain, Perry and Gingrich was easy? Just ask Rick Santorum. He ended up with the silver.\\nRICK SANTORUM (R), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We will suspend our campaign effective today.\\nBERMAN: Pole vault, the latest \\\"Wall Street Journal\\\"/NBC poll showed the president vaulting to a six-point lead. Synchronized diving even without the Speedos, both campaigns medal in endless precision repetition.\\nMITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Middle class.\\nBARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: The middle class.\\nROMNEY: Create jobs.\\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Create jobs.\\nBERMAN: While we're in the pool, a politician's least favorite event, the backstroke. Former New Hampshire Governor John Sununu just visited the podium after saying the president need to learn how to be an American. Check out his backstroke.\\nJOHN SUNUNU, FORMER NEW HAMPSHIRE GOVERNOR: Frankly, I made a mistake. I shouldn't have used those words and I apologize for using those words.\\nBERMAN: Weight lifting, Mitt Romney better have big arms to lift the bags of money his campaign has raked in. Finally, if there's one Olympic sport our leaders know all too well, it's gymnastics. Not all of them can handle the flips. This was Gary Bower in 2000. But today's crop is adept at the verbal gymnastics, the contortions, turns and, yes, the twists.\\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: He's been twisting my words around to suggest that I don't value small business.\\nROMNEY: Their opposition people look for anything they can find to distort, to twist and try and make negative.\\nBERMAN: With all that twisting, let's get these guys on the balance beam. Meanwhile, we can only hope they don't discover beach volleyball. America couldn't bear the outfits.\\nBERMAN: You know, it's also a good thing it's not winter or we would be talking about ice dancing. Now, in terms of what the candidates will be watching, we know President Obama met with the men's basketball team. We know he's a big fan of theirs. And Mitt Romney says he hopes to check out some swimming before he leaves London. And you could say he's already been working on his backstroke after this kerfuffle over the whole U.S./London ready thing -- Wolf.\\nBLITZER: Who writes that material? Do you write all that yourself, John?\\nBERMAN: I have a staff of thousands.\\nBLITZER: That's terrific writing.\\nBERMAN: Thank you. I appreciate that very much.\\nBLITZER: Great stuff. John Berman, excellent work. I loved it. All right, thanks so much. Important note to all of our viewers, you can catch John along with Zoraida Sambolin every morning on \\\"EARLY START\\\" right here at CNN. That \\\"EARLY START\\\" starts at 5:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. Eastern only on CNN. Get up early even if you don't check it out. I think you'll like it. Mitt Romney himself is making the political Olympic analogy touting his experience organizing the Salt Lake City winter games in 2002. Listen to what he tells CNN's Piers Morgan in an interview in London that will air later tonight.\\nROMNEY: The country is in need of a turnaround. The Olympics was a turnaround for businesses I've been associated with that needed a turnaround. That kind of experience of focusing on the most critical issue, building the most effective team possible, creating a common vision, unifying around that vision and then delivering results is something I think the American people would like to see in our economy right now.\\nBLITZER: Once again that interview with Romney on \\\"PIERS MORGAN TONIGHT\\\" at 9:00 p.m. Eastern. All right, let's talk a little bit about that and more in our \\\"Strategy Session\\\" joining us our CNN political contributor, the Democratic strategist Donna Brazile and our CNN contributor, Ana Navarro. She was the national Hispanic co-chair for Jon Huntsman's presidential campaign. Ana, so far not starting off on a great note in Britain especially when you compare --\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I just lost Wolf.\""

I'm first lady.\nKAYE (voice-over): As you might imagine, Ivana calling herself the first lady didn't sit so well with the real first lady.

She loves living in Washington, D.C., and is honored by her role as first lady of the United States.

I'd like to get Marla Maples in there. I think she maybe has unresolved issues. And I feel it would be great to have Ivanka Trump there as well. I will set up two couches, get this going, and just put me in the game, I can do this.\\nCOOPER: We're going have more of my conversation with Andy at the 9:00 hour including tips from Andy's \\\"Housewives\\\" playbook. Up next the escalating fight between the president and the sitting Republican senator, a powerful sitting Republican senator who says the president is putting the country at risk of World War III.\""

President Trump's recent back and forth with the father of a UCLA basketball player has revived questions about the president and race. The president was outraged that this father LaVar Ball refused to thank him for helping free his son LiAngelo Ball from custody, one of three athletes arrested for shoplifting. The president called LaVar Ball, quote, an ungrateful fool and the poor man's version of Don King without hair all over Twitter who could have spent, quote, the next five to ten years during Thanksgiving with your son in China but no NBA contract to support you. So adding to that today, the ghost writer to the president's best- seller Art of the Deal is saying this about why the president crossed the line to cut down LaVar Ball.\nTONY SCHWARTZ, TRUMP'S GHOSTWRITER FOR ART OF THE DEAL: I think Trump is half awed and half frightened by black people and his only way of dealing with them is to attack them. And on the other hand, I think he has a zero tolerance for any criticism of any kind.\nBALDWIN: Let's start there. CNN political commentators Paris Dennard and Sally Kohn are with me. Happy thanksgiving first and foremost to both of you. Paris, you heard Tony Schwartz saying the president is half awed and half frightened by black people. What do you think that means and would you like to comment on that?\nPARIS DENNARD, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATORS: I mean, first of all, Happy Thanksgiving. I think Tony is ridiculous in his statements. I find it interesting that after this man becomes the president of the United States is when he decides to really become so negative, rude and political. But the fact that President Trump is awed by African-American people is not a bad thing. I think a lot of people are awed by successful groups of people, people who are accomplished. I think the president likes and is awed by a lot of people who are successful, who are -- who are the best at their game, who strive and overcome obstacles and become number one, who are winners.\nBALDWIN: Do we think that's how Tony Schwartz meant it?\nDENNARD: I don't know if that's -- I don't know if that's how Tony Schwartz meant it. I doubt it. But that's how the president is. I've interacted with him many, many times. I've seen him with large groups of black people and that is not a man who is by any means frightened by African-Americans. I think that notion is absurd and I think it's highly offensive to have him equate that to this man. If you are a racist, you don't appoint or put the first African- American woman to be the -- your press secretary to the campaign. If you are a racist or you're afraid of black people, you don't invite the largest number of HBCU presidents and chancellors in your office to meet with them if you're afraid of black people or if you're somehow a racist. This is not something that is racist or someone who is a scared of black people does. And so I think these comments just reinforce a false narrative about this president because we were all surprised to see the president did so well with the African-American community. He has a long positive history with the black community going back for many, many years, many decades and it is continuing now with his agenda, especially when you look at the tax cut plan that will impact small business owners, as well as middle class Americans, which is a lot of African-Americans just like myself. So this is something that is unfortunate and I don't know why Tony is doing it, but I guess it's just for him to get more publicity off the back of the president of the United States.\nBALDWIN: OK. Paris, that's how you see it. Sally Kohn, how do you see it?\nSALLY KOHN, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I'm glad Paris brought up a false narrative. I agree there is a false narrative here.

It comes after they notified families that search-and-rescue efforts ended. CNN's Polo Sandoval joins us now. Polo, tell us about these three young men.\nPOLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This is the personal side of these heroes. The Navy had been holding off releasing information until they could notify families. Today, this information released by the government. I want to tell you a little about these men, now identified by the U.S. Navy as Lieutenant Steven Combs, a man from Florida, assigned to provider's fleet of logistical support squadron 30. Airman Matthew Chialastri from Louisiana was assigned to \"USS Ronald Reagan,\" as was Airman Apprentice Bryan Grosso from Florida. They did not survive the crash earlier this week. They were among 11 crew and passengers on a Navy transport plane that crashed as it approached an air carrier Wednesday in the western Pacific. At least eight of those individuals were rescued by officials, both from Japan and the U.S. They covered about 1,000 nautical miles in a desperate search for any sign of the three men. Sadly, presumed dead by the Navy and now family members are aware, their sons will not come home. This investigation is on-going now, Ana. We understand Japanese defense minister said they believe engine trouble may be to blame, but the investigation is still on-going.\nCABRERA: And yet, this is a tough year for the Navy, the Seventh fleet specifically, lost 17 servicemembers in a number of different incidents. What's going on?\nSANDOVAL: Seventeen men and women there. Important to point out this has happened over time. When you look at the list, Ana, it is tragic to see lives are lost after these incidents. In August, the deadly collision with the \"USS McCain\" and a merchant ship. That left at least 10 sailors dead. Back in June, a missile destroy are, \"USS Fitzgerald\" collided with a cargo ship, seven dead there. Two fatal incidents out of the list were later determined to be, quote, \"avoidable,\" and also the result of, quote, \"numerous failings occurred on the part of leadership,\" according to a Navy report. So clearly some serious issues there. Some top Navy officers lost jobs over this. Important to point out with the loss of the three men, it seems this was an accident. They're still investigating. As we mentioned, they believe engine trouble may be to blame. So a different situation. Nonetheless, tragic for the three men not coming home.\nCABRERA: Polo Sandoval, thank you.\nSANDOVAL: Thanks, Ana.\nCABRERA: Infighting in the Trump administration is threatening to overshadow a major global summit. State Department officials tell CNN the U.S. is not sending a high-level delegation to next week's Global Entrepreneurship Summit in India. The main reason, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson doesn't want to support Ivanka Trump, who is leading the U.S. delegation at this event. CNN senior diplomatic correspondent, Michelle Kosinski, broke this story and joins us with more details -- Michelle?\nMICHELLE KOSINSKI, CNN SENIOR DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT: What we're talking about here is the Global Entrepreneurship Summit. It is a big event, put on by the State Department. This year, first daughter and senior White House adviser, Ivanka Trump, is headlining it. She leaves this weekend. She was invited by the Indian prime minister. And the theme is women's entrepreneurship. What we are hearing from several sources, including senior ones in the State Department, as well as the White House, Rex Tillerson and his inner circle don't want to send senior people because they don't love the idea of Ivanka Trump leading the U.S. delegation here. From a senior State Department official, \"They,\" meaning Tillerson and staff, \"won't send someone senior because they don't want to bolster Ivanka.\" Another rift at a time Rex Tillerson doesn't need more problems with the president. From a source close to the White House, \"Rex doesn't like that he is supposed to be the top diplomat and Jared and Ivanka stepped all over him.

The announcement coming from the Kremlin just days after the U.S. booted 60 Russian diplomats to protest the poisoning of a former double-agent and his daughter in the U.K. Press secretary Sarah Sanders calls the expulsions a further deterioration in the United States-Russia relationship, already at a low, and the Trump administration will quote \"deal with it.\" So let's go live to Moscow now and bring in CNN's Phil Black.

How concerned are Russian officials now that the U.S. is just going to retaliate for this retaliation?\nPHIL BLACK, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Russia is saying Michelle that the ball is in your court to the United States because they have chosen to match those expulsions as you detailed there, match the closure of the consulate -- in this case, Saint Petersburg. They believe that's the reasonable response but they say that they will take more action against the United States if the U.S. acts against Russia's interests any further. And the U.S., of course, has said well, we reserve the right to take further actions as well. So it remains to be seen if this draws a line under this current round of tit for tat diplomatic expulsions of whether there is still more action to be seen. But it reinforces what we've come to realize is that this is a historic low in relations between Russia and the United States. Interestingly here, for all the anger directed at the United States over these expulsions there is very little criticism of President Trump himself. There is still a belief here that President Trump would improve relations with Russia if he were allowed to, but Russian officials believe that he is held back -- restricted by an anti- Russian political class in the United States -- Michelle.\nKOSINSKI: Yes, this has been a difficult back-and-forth.

    "source": "SCIUTTO: The Republican candidate for Florida's governor under fire once again. Just days after Congressman Ron DeSantis was accused of using a racist term, the \"Washington Post\" reports that DeSantis spoke at multiple racially charged events, this dating back to 2013. At these conferences, you'd hear hundreds of people, many of the speakers right-wing speakers, but also some of them known racists, bigots, Milo Yiannopoulos, Sebastian Gorka, who's had anti-Muslim positions. CNN's senior Washington correspondent, Joe Johns, joins me now. So first of all, at these events, you have a variety of viewpoints, many from the right, certainly not all racists and not all bigoted, but those kinds of voices seem to be a regular feature at these events.\nJOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Right. And I think it's important for a variety of reasons. Number one, because, right now -- and you have to underscore this -- he's running against an African-American candidate, Andrew Gillum, who's the Tallahassee mayor, and he makes a comment, for example, on television, saying, we don't want to \"monkey up the state.\" And the question, of course, was whether that was a racist comment or not. He said it wasn't intended to be racist. But now you overlay that with this disclosure in the \"Washington Post\" that he's appeared four times before this group, organized by a conservative who has brought in these types of viewpoints, repeatedly. Then it starts to paint a bit of a more of a picture. And also important, I think, because the African-American community, already galvanized by the possibility of first African-American governor for the state of Florida, and now has these questions about the Republican candidate.\nSCIUTTO: And the point about DeSantis -- and some of this came up when he used the racially charged term -- is that, here's an experienced politician, sitting Congressman, I believe he's a military vet.\nJOHNS: Right.\nSCIUTTO: Smart guy, right? But he's been -- if he's been going to these events, going back to 2013, none of this should be a surprise to him, right? You wouldn't go to the event and not know the kind of stuff that is being said.\nJOHNS: Right. And the question becomes whether this is all a wink and a nod to bring out those voters who support right-wing notions. Of course, he's also considered a very big Donald Trump supporter.\nSCIUTTO: So he's resigned his seat. He's also not running again for his congressional seat. But we're early September.\nJOHNS: Right.\nSCIUTTO: So until that election, there's been several weeks here, where no one's sitting in that seat.\nJOHNS: Precisely. And Florida is trying to figure out what to do. They are planning a conference call this afternoon to determine whether or not there ought to be a special election to have somebody in that seat, the sixth district, through the end of December, into the beginning of January, when the new Congress is sworn in. Because the question is whether there's enough time, particularly, to get military ballots out, which have to go out 45 days before the election, and what are they going to do? Because somebody's got to be in that seat, presumably, if they can, until January.\nSCIUTTO: But there are already candidates in place, Democratic and Republican, to fill that seat in the regular general election.\nJOHNS: Right. The primary was the 28th of August. There's a Republican, there's a Democrat, and DeSantis was presumed to be not running.\nSCIUTTO: Right. Joe Johns, thanks very much for clearing up for us. That is it for me today, Jim Sciutto, sitting in for Wolf. NEWSROOM with Brooke Baldwin starts right now.\nBROOKE BALDWIN, CNN ANCHOR: All right. Hi, there. I'm Brooke Baldwin. Thank you so much for being with me. We are minutes away from the first White House briefing in nearly three weeks. It comes as President Trump claims the White House is a smooth-running machine, despite the fact that his own vice president has offered to take a lie detector test. It's to prove he did not write that withering \"New York Times\" opinion piece, slamming the president, and as administration officials try to figure out which one of their own is not telling the truth. The president is calling Bob Woodward a liar. The acclaimed journalist, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist of Watergate fame, debuts his Trump tell-all, \"Fear\" -- the name of his book -- tomorrow. And the president is discrediting Woodward's account of an administration in an unprecedented crisis. Trump tweeted, the Woodward book is a, quote, \"scam,\" and a \"joke\" that should not be taken with a grain of salt. And here is what he says about Woodward. Trump cites Savannah Guthrie, the host of the \"Today\" show, who interviewed Woodward this morning. Quote, \"It is mostly anonymous sources in here. Why should anyone trust you? General Mattis, General Kelly said it's not true.\" Trump then writes, quote, \"Bob Woodward is a liar who is like a Dem operative prior to the midterms. He was caught cold even by NBC.\"",

So first of all, at these events, you have a variety of viewpoints, many from the right, certainly not all racists and not all bigoted, but those kinds of voices seem to be a regular feature at these events.\\nJOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Right. And I think it's important for a variety of reasons. Number one, because, right now -- and you have to underscore this -- he's running against an African-American candidate, Andrew Gillum, who's the Tallahassee mayor, and he makes a comment, for example, on television, saying, we don't want to \\\"monkey up the state.\\\" And the question, of course, was whether that was a racist comment or not. He said it wasn't intended to be racist. But now you overlay that with this disclosure in the \\\"Washington Post\\\" that he's appeared four times before this group, organized by a conservative who has brought in these types of viewpoints, repeatedly. Then it starts to paint a bit of a more of a picture. And also important, I think, because the African-American community, already galvanized by the possibility of first African-American governor for the state of Florida, and now has these questions about the Republican candidate.\\nSCIUTTO: And the point about DeSantis -- and some of this came up when he used the racially charged term -- is that, here's an experienced politician, sitting Congressman, I believe he's a military vet.\\nJOHNS: Right.\\nSCIUTTO: Smart guy, right? But he's been -- if he's been going to these events, going back to 2013, none of this should be a surprise to him, right? You wouldn't go to the event and not know the kind of stuff that is being said.\\nJOHNS: Right. And the question becomes whether this is all a wink and a nod to bring out those voters who support right-wing notions. Of course, he's also considered a very big Donald Trump supporter.\\nSCIUTTO: So he's resigned his seat. He's also not running again for his congressional seat. But we're early September.\\nJOHNS: Right.\\nSCIUTTO: So until that election, there's been several weeks here, where no one's sitting in that seat.\\nJOHNS: Precisely. And Florida is trying to figure out what to do. They are planning a conference call this afternoon to determine whether or not there ought to be a special election to have somebody in that seat, the sixth district, through the end of December, into the beginning of January, when the new Congress is sworn in. Because the question is whether there's enough time, particularly, to get military ballots out, which have to go out 45 days before the election, and what are they going to do? Because somebody's got to be in that seat, presumably, if they can, until January.\\nSCIUTTO: But there are already candidates in place, Democratic and Republican, to fill that seat in the regular general election.\\nJOHNS: Right. The primary was the 28th of August. There's a Republican, there's a Democrat, and DeSantis was presumed to be not running.\\nSCIUTTO: Right. Joe Johns, thanks very much for clearing up for us.

    "source": "BLITZER: Tonight, House Democrats are accusing President Trump of committing multiple federal crimes, including bribery, even though they were not explicitly referenced in the articles of impeachment. We're joined now by Democratic Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, a member of both the Intelligence and Oversight committees. Congressman, thanks so much for joining us.\nREP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL): Thank you.\nBLITZER: And let's walk through what the House of Representatives is about to do. They will take a historic vote to impeach the president on Wednesday. Walk us through what will happen.\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, as you know, there are two articles of impeachment, one for abuse of power and the other for obstruction of Congress. And so there will be a vote on these articles. Obviously, I don't think that the speaker is doing anything other than directing people to vote per their conscience and their constituents. And I think that's what people are going to do on Wednesday.\nBLITZER: Your Republican colleague Will Hurd of Texas says, you can vote against impeachment, but still disagree with some of the president's behavior. How do you respond to that?\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I respectfully disagree with my colleague, in the sense that this type of behavior is precisely why the framers of the Constitution incorporated an impeachment provision within the Constitution. The framers were deeply concerned about foreign powers getting involved in the domestic affairs of America. And, specifically, they would have been extremely concerned about pressuring a foreign power or getting a foreign power to get involved in our elections. In this particular case, that's exactly what the evidence shows that the president, over a pattern of -- over several months exhibited a pattern of conduct in which he pressured the Ukrainians to basically investigate his political rivals, thereby compromising national security and the integrity of our elections, Wolf.\nBLITZER: What does it say to you, Congressman, that not a single Republican in the House is expected to vote for either of these articles of impeachment?\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, as you know, Justin Amash, I guess, was a Republican before he disagreed with the president. I think that he will probably vote in favor of the articles. That being said, at this point, I think everyone has to vote their conscience and has to do the right thing and put the Constitution above party and politics. That's extremely important.\nBLITZER: Should Justin Amash, who is now an independent member of the House, serve as an impeachment case manager, a manager in the course of the trial in the Senate, as some of your Democratic colleagues are recommending?\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't want to speculate on who the manager is going to be. I know that Nancy Pelosi is going to assemble a team that knows the facts and brings credit to the House in presenting the case in the Senate.\nBLITZER: In an interview, a new interview, as we have been reporting, in \"The New Yorker\" magazine, Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, made this admission about his campaign to push out the former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. He says this. He says: \"I believed that I needed Yovanovitch out of the way. She was going to make the investigations difficult for everybody.\" So, what do you think? How significant is that admission by Giuliani?\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I think it's very significant. And that's what the evidence showed during the hearings, that Rudy Giuliani and the president basically pushed Ambassador Yovanovitch away to basically install Rudy Giuliani in charge of Ukraine policy, along with the three amigos, Ambassador Sondland, Rick Perry and Volker, Ambassador Volker. And, basically, what they sought to do was to basically commandeer Ukraine policy in favor of Donald Trump's political ambitions. And, as I said before, that's a shadow foreign policy. That is not necessarily in the best interests of the country, but maybe in the best interest of Rudy Giuliani's clients and Donald Trump's political agenda. But that's not the way that our foreign policy should ever be run.\nBLITZER: Should Giuliani be called as a witness?\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't know. We have never received the documents that were subpoenaed from Giuliani. I personally -- I'm speaking for myself. I personally believe that we should always view documents from a witness before they are examined in terms of their live testimony. And so I'd like to see those documents first.\nBLITZER: Congressman Krishnamoorthi, thanks so much for joining us.\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Thank you so much.\nBLITZER: All right, just ahead, we're going to have much more on Rudy Giuliani unplugged when it comes to Ukraine. Why is he apparently admitting he wanted the former U.S. ambassador ousted, so he could freely dig up dirt for the -- on the Bidens? Plus, after two crashes, why is Boeing now halting, halting production of the 737 MAX?",

        "\"BLITZER: Tonight, House Democrats are accusing President Trump of committing multiple federal crimes, including bribery, even though they were not explicitly referenced in the articles of impeachment. We're joined now by Democratic Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, a member of both the Intelligence and Oversight committees. Congressman, thanks so much for joining us.\\nREP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL): Thank you.\\nBLITZER: And let's walk through what the House of Representatives is about to do. They will take a historic vote to impeach the president on Wednesday. Walk us through what will happen.\\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, as you know, there are two articles of impeachment, one for abuse of power and the other for obstruction of Congress. And so there will be a vote on these articles. Obviously, I don't think that the speaker is doing anything other than directing people to vote per their conscience and their constituents. And I think that's what people are going to do on Wednesday.\\nBLITZER: Your Republican colleague Will Hurd of Texas says, you can vote against impeachment, but still disagree with some of the president's behavior. How do you respond to that?\\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I respectfully disagree with my colleague, in the sense that this type of behavior is precisely why the framers of the Constitution incorporated an impeachment provision within the Constitution. The framers were deeply concerned about foreign powers getting involved in the domestic affairs of America. And, specifically, they would have been extremely concerned about pressuring a foreign power or getting a foreign power to get involved in our elections. In this particular case, that's exactly what the evidence shows that the president, over a pattern of -- over several months exhibited a pattern of conduct in which he pressured the Ukrainians to basically investigate his political rivals, thereby compromising national security and the integrity of our elections, Wolf.\\nBLITZER: What does it say to you, Congressman, that not a single Republican in the House is expected to vote for either of these articles of impeachment?\\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, as you know, Justin Amash, I guess, was a Republican before he disagreed with the president. I think that he will probably vote in favor of the articles. That being said, at this point, I think everyone has to vote their conscience and has to do the right thing and put the Constitution above party and politics. That's extremely important.\\nBLITZER: Should Justin Amash, who is now an independent member of the House, serve as an impeachment case manager, a manager in the course of the trial in the Senate, as some of your Democratic colleagues are recommending?\\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't want to speculate on who the manager is going to be. I know that Nancy Pelosi is going to assemble a team that knows the facts and brings credit to the House in presenting the case in the Senate.\\nBLITZER: In an interview, a new interview, as we have been reporting, in \\\"The New Yorker\\\" magazine, Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, made this admission about his campaign to push out the former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. He says this. He says: \\\"I believed that I needed Yovanovitch out of the way. She was going to make the investigations difficult for everybody.\\\" So, what do you think? How significant is that admission by Giuliani?\\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I think it's very significant. And that's what the evidence showed during the hearings, that Rudy Giuliani and the president basically pushed Ambassador Yovanovitch away to basically install Rudy Giuliani in charge of Ukraine policy, along with the three amigos, Ambassador Sondland, Rick Perry and Volker, Ambassador Volker. And, basically, what they sought to do was to basically commandeer Ukraine policy in favor of Donald Trump's political ambitions. And, as I said before, that's a shadow foreign policy. That is not necessarily in the best interests of the country, but maybe in the best interest of Rudy Giuliani's clients and Donald Trump's political agenda. But that's not the way that our foreign policy should ever be run.\\nBLITZER: Should Giuliani be called as a witness?\\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't know. We have never received the documents that were subpoenaed from Giuliani. I personally -- I'm speaking for myself. I personally believe that we should always view documents from a witness before they are examined in terms of their live testimony. And so I'd like to see those documents first.\\nBLITZER: Congressman Krishnamoorthi, thanks so much for joining us.\\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Thank you so much.\\nBLITZER: All right, just ahead, we're going to have much more on Rudy Giuliani unplugged when it comes to Ukraine. Why is he apparently admitting he wanted the former U.S. ambassador ousted, so he could freely dig up dirt for the -- on the Bidens? Plus, after two crashes, why is Boeing now halting, halting production of the 737 MAX?\""

    "source": "AARON BROWN, CNN ANCHOR: The day, of course, began with news -- at least began for us with news that a CBS employee, an assistant to CBS news anchor Dan Rather has been diagnosed with the skin form of anthrax. That's where we'll begin this hour's coverage. Michael Okwu joins us with more on that -- Michael.\nMICHAEL OKWU, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Aaron, good afternoon. Apparently, she is a young woman. And she is on antibiotics. Officials here say that she's responding well to those antibiotics and that she is resting comfortably at home. Now, CBS officials say that one of her duties is to open mail for Mr. Rather, but it is unclear how she contracted anthrax. There's absolutely no evidence at this point, they say, that any of the mail or any of the envelopes received here in the past couple weeks was suspicious. And there's no indication at this time that anyone else at CBS was exposed to anthrax. Now this morning, Mayor Giuliani at a press conference said that she noticed swelling on October 1. After she noticed this swelling, she went to her medical team, her doctors, who prescribed penicillin for her on the fourth. But last Friday when she heard about the news at NBC, the case of anthrax there, she became nervous and contacted health officials. She was then tested and found positive for anthrax and was given Cipro. Authorities are confident, however, that this is an isolated case.\nMAYOR RUDOLPH GIULIANI (R), NEW YORK: She is recovering, if not recovered completely. She responded well to both the penicillin and the Cipro and should be all right. And that she works at CBS. She handles mail. And no one else at CBS, during this very lengthy time period, which is what it is, since October 1, from what we can tell, has any symptoms. So there's no indication that anything got spread to anyone else.\nOKWU: We've counted about two dozen representatives from the CDC who have entered this building. At this point, of course, CBS is still operational. It is still open. And there are just throngs of media here -- Aaron.\nBROWN: And just -- Michael, just to reiterate one point -- are CBS News employees being tested now, or is the assumption that if it had happened we'd already know?\nOKWU: Well, they -- the authorities are very confident that if this had happened that we would already know. But there are people in the mail room which, of course, seems to be the pattern these days who are being tested. And they are conducting tests on that mail room, environmental tests for that space, as well as environmental tests for spaces beyond the mail room. And that's going to be going on for the better part of this afternoon -- Aaron.\nBROWN: Michael, thank you. Michael Okwu on the CBS story. On the subject of mail and mail rooms: The Associated Press is just now reporting that a New Jersey postal worker has now tested positive for exposure to anthrax. We don't know -- at least, I don't know where that postal worker worked. But we do know that a couple of the letters that contained anthrax were mailed out of New Jersey. And we recall that two New Jersey postal workers had complained earlier in the week of flu-like symptoms, which may have been the flu or may not have been the flu, of course. In any case, one worker, according to AP, has now tested positively for exposure to anthrax. And again, we make the distinction, we'll make it often, there is a huge difference between being exposed to anthrax and actually contracting anthrax. It is not a little distinction. It can be a life and death distinction. And so we're very careful in how we say this. The postal worker exposed. Judy, good afternoon.\nJUDY WOODRUFF, CNN ANCHOR: Good afternoon, Aaron. The numbers keep climbing. By my count, we're now over 40 with this number -- with this new announcement coming out of New Jersey. And again, CNN hasn't confirmed that. But as Aaron said, this is a report from The Associated Press. TO ORDER A VIDEO OF THIS TRANSCRIPT, PLEASE CALL 800-CNN-NEWS OR USE OUR SECURE ONLINE ORDER FORM LOCATED AT www.fdch.com",

On the subject of mail and mail rooms: The Associated Press is just now reporting that a New Jersey postal worker has now tested positive for exposure to anthrax. We don't know -- at least, I don't know where that postal worker worked. But we do know that a couple of the letters that contained anthrax were mailed out of New Jersey. And we recall that two New Jersey postal workers had complained earlier in the week of flu-like symptoms, which may have been the flu or may not have been the flu, of course. In any case, one worker, according to AP, has now tested positively for exposure to anthrax. And again, we make the distinction, we'll make it often, there is a huge difference between being exposed to anthrax and actually contracting anthrax. It is not a little distinction. It can be a life and death distinction. And so we're very careful in how we say this. The postal worker exposed. Judy, good afternoon.\\nJUDY WOODRUFF, CNN ANCHOR: Good afternoon, Aaron.

That's where we'll begin this hour's coverage. Michael Okwu joins us with more on that -- Michael.\nMICHAEL OKWU, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Aaron, good afternoon. Apparently, she is a young woman. And she is on antibiotics. Officials here say that she's responding well to those antibiotics and that she is resting comfortably at home. Now, CBS officials say that one of her duties is to open mail for Mr. Rather, but it is unclear how she contracted anthrax. There's absolutely no evidence at this point, they say, that any of the mail or any of the envelopes received here in the past couple weeks was suspicious. And there's no indication at this time that anyone else at CBS was exposed to anthrax. Now this morning, Mayor Giuliani at a press conference said that she noticed swelling on October 1. After she noticed this swelling, she went to her medical team, her doctors, who prescribed penicillin for her on the fourth. But last Friday when she heard about the news at NBC, the case of anthrax there, she became nervous and contacted health officials. She was then tested and found positive for anthrax and was given Cipro. Authorities are confident, however, that this is an isolated case.\nMAYOR RUDOLPH GIULIANI (R), NEW YORK: She is recovering, if not recovered completely. She responded well to both the penicillin and the Cipro and should be all right. And that she works at CBS. She handles mail. And no one else at CBS, during this very lengthy time period, which is what it is, since October 1, from what we can tell, has any symptoms. So there's no indication that anything got spread to anyone else.\nOKWU: We've counted about two dozen representatives from the CDC who have entered this building. At this point, of course, CBS is still operational. It is still open. And there are just throngs of media here -- Aaron.\nBROWN: And just -- Michael, just to reiterate one point -- are CBS News employees being tested now, or is the assumption that if it had happened we'd already know?\nOKWU: Well, they -- the authorities are very confident that if this had happened that we would already know. But there are people in the mail room which, of course, seems to be the pattern these days who are being tested. And they are conducting tests on that mail room, environmental tests for that space, as well as environmental tests for spaces beyond the mail room.

The Haitians were rounded up yesterday after many of them jumped from a packed wooden boat into the surf off of Key Biscayne. Immigration authorities are conducting a criminal investigation, as Susan Candiotti reports now live from Miami. Susan, it was a wild scene to watch as it developed.\nSUSAN CANDIOTTI, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It was. A very, still emotionally and politically charged issue, as these more than 200, as you indicated, Haitian migrants making their way to the Miami shoreline yesterday afternoon. You saw these pictures, which are, as we said, quite remarkable. Men, women and children jumping from this boat, in shallow waters around Miami's Key Biscayne area and in fact wading to shore. Many of these people wearing their Sunday finest clothes as they made this treacherous journey from Haiti to the United States. Very controversial in this particular area because, you can see the crossing that they made. And they were at sea for many, many, many days. And it is controversial because of the difference between the way Haitian migrants, or example and Cuban migrants. Cubans, for the most part, are treated as political refugees. And if they reach the shores, they are automatically allowed to remain in the United States. That is not the case with Haitian migrants who most always are sent back because they are viewed as economic refugees. However, all of these migrants will be able to make their case. They hope, anyway, if they are able to hire lawyers and try to make a case, many of them, that they are political refugees, as well. Now, today there was a brief meeting set up during a campaign appearance by Governor Jeb Bush, who is, of course, campaigning for re-election here. And he made a stop at a local school in Miami. At that time, among the people who were there on the podium with him, Congressman Carrie Meek -- Congresswoman Carrie Meek who is a Democrat, and she directly approached the governor on this issue in a very dramatic way. Listen.\nREP. CARRIE MEEK (D), FLORIDA: I came to ask you if you would call your brother and ask him to call INS to release the Haitians that are in detention. They don't need a new policy. All they have to do is call. The wet foot/dry foot policy will take effect. Those Haitians are standing on dry land. My blood has been transferred to them, governor.\nBUSH: Congresswoman, I appreciate it.\nQUESTION: I love them.\nBUSH: I respect your position.\nQUESTION: Please, call him, governor, and ask him to please -- you can do it.\nBUSH: Thank you.\nQUESTION: We can't do it. The Congress can't do it. We tried our best. We can't do it. If you call him...\nBUSH: You know, we worked together in 1998 to change the immigration laws. With your leadership, that occurred to provide for more just treatment of Haitians. My position is, as I stated, if people have a well-founded fear of persecution, they should be allowed into the community, out of Krome and they should be able to pursue those remedies through administrative...\nQUESTION: Tell your brother they can be released right now. You can.\nCANDIOTTI: Well, Haitian Americans plan to keep drumming this issue as best they can. And there have been a number of demonstrations, a couple yesterday, one this morning, and another one scheduled outside the offices and headquarters of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Services this afternoon as many people protest the treatment of these Haitian migrants. It's certainly an issue, Martin, that is not going to go away any time soon. It comes up time and again. And all kinds of questions being raised about it again. And not a good time, certainly, for Governor Jeb Bush during his re-election campaign.\nSAVIDGE: That's what I was going to ask you about. You mention the issue of timing here. Jeb Bush in a very tight race and now this literally lands on his doorstep. What are the potential pitfalls for him?\nCANDIOTTI: Reporter: well, certainly there could be major pitfalls for him in certain segments of the community. Those people who think that these migrants are being treated unfairly might decide to take up this issue and, you know, go against Governor Jeb Bush at the election polls. We have not heard yet, to the best of my knowledge, from his opponent, Democrat Jim McBride, who is running against Governor Jeb Bush. So we'll wait to see what happens as the day goes on.\nSAVIDGE: We certainly will. Susan Candiotti reporting to us from Miami. Thank you very much. Center in Florida>",

        "\"MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN ANCHOR: More than 200 illegal immigrants from Haiti are now at a detention center today in Florida, awaiting processing. The Haitians were rounded up yesterday after many of them jumped from a packed wooden boat into the surf off of Key Biscayne. Immigration authorities are conducting a criminal investigation, as Susan Candiotti reports now live from Miami. Susan, it was a wild scene to watch as it developed.\\nSUSAN CANDIOTTI, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It was. A very, still emotionally and politically charged issue, as these more than 200, as you indicated, Haitian migrants making their way to the Miami shoreline yesterday afternoon. You saw these pictures, which are, as we said, quite remarkable. Men, women and children jumping from this boat, in shallow waters around Miami's Key Biscayne area and in fact wading to shore. Many of these people wearing their Sunday finest clothes as they made this treacherous journey from Haiti to the United States. Very controversial in this particular area because, you can see the crossing that they made. And they were at sea for many, many, many days. And it is controversial because of the difference between the way Haitian migrants, or example and Cuban migrants. Cubans, for the most part, are treated as political refugees. And if they reach the shores, they are automatically allowed to remain in the United States. That is not the case with Haitian migrants who most always are sent back because they are viewed as economic refugees. However, all of these migrants will be able to make their case. They hope, anyway, if they are able to hire lawyers and try to make a case, many of them, that they are political refugees, as well. Now, today there was a brief meeting set up during a campaign appearance by Governor Jeb Bush, who is, of course, campaigning for re-election here. And he made a stop at a local school in Miami. At that time, among the people who were there on the podium with him, Congressman Carrie Meek -- Congresswoman Carrie Meek who is a Democrat, and she directly approached the governor on this issue in a very dramatic way. Listen.\\nREP. CARRIE MEEK (D), FLORIDA: I came to ask you if you would call your brother and ask him to call INS to release the Haitians that are in detention. They don't need a new policy. All they have to do is call. The wet foot/dry foot policy will take effect. Those Haitians are standing on dry land.

While the Pyongyang government aims angry words at the United States, the Bush administration is sticking to plans of diplomacy. We check in with senior White House correspondent John King -- John.\nJOHN KING, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Fredricka, hello to you. The latest words from North Korea that are of concern to the Bush administration, talk in North Korea that perhaps it will resume missile tests. Tests of missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons. This, of course, on the heels of a decision of the North Korea government to restart a nuclear reactor that is critical to its nuclear weapon's program. North Korea also says it will withdraw from participating in the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. The Bush administration approach under fire back here in the United States. The president has said he is willing to talk with North Korea but not negotiate. Mr. Bush says there will be no concessions, no incentives from the United States that North Korea must agree publicly to abandon the weapons program. Many key Democrats, including Senator Carl Levin of Michigan who is a senior member of the Senate Arms Services Committee say that's a mistake. They say the Bush administration should sit down with North Korea, no conditions.\nSEN. CARL LEVIN (D), MICHIGAN: I think it's wrong, and there ought to be direct dialogue and at a high level. It doesn't mean you're going to capitulate. Doesn't mean you are going to give concessions. All it means is you're going to talk to people to avoid miscalculation, and so they know directly what is on our mind and we can hear from them what is directly on their mind.\nKING: Also some criticism today from some key Republicans. The president has said repeatedly that he has no plans and no intention of any hostile action military action toward North Korea. Senator John McCain of Arizona says heading into any negotiations or any conversations, the president should keep all options on the table, including the prospect of military force.\nSEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: It is a clear and present danger to the United States of America, they've now developed at least two nuclear weapons. If they -- if this situation continues as it is, they will have six or eight more. That gives them an enormous amount of flexibility. They've tested a missile. It could strike Tokyo. And they're developing missiles that can strike the United States of America. The United States needs to take vigorous action with our allies. But if not, on our own.\nKING: The Bush administration maintains it is confident all of this can be resolved peacefully through diplomacy. For now though, the Bush administration's direct diplomacy is aimed at not at North Korea, but at South Korea. Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly is in Seoul, South Korea for talks with South Korean officials including South Korea's president elect. There's been some criticism of the administration from that key ally, from Seoul. In Seoul, they believe the Bush administration is taking too hard of a line when it comes to North Korea. Now, North Korean officials did met with a former Clinton administration diplomat, Bill Richardson, now the governor of New Mexico, over the weekend. Those North Korean officials, we are told, told Governor Richardson they would like to have meetings with Bush administration officials as soon as possible at the United Nations in New York. Senior administration officials telling us today there are no talks scheduled. They do not rule them out, though. Perhaps some contact in the near future, we are told, to watch for, but the administration holding to this bottom line. Says it will talk to North Korea, but only about getting a commitment from North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program.

There's been some criticism of the administration from that key ally, from Seoul. In Seoul, they believe the Bush administration is taking too hard of a line when it comes to North Korea. Now, North Korean officials did met with a former Clinton administration diplomat, Bill Richardson, now the governor of New Mexico, over the weekend. Those North Korean officials, we are told, told Governor Richardson they would like to have meetings with Bush administration officials as soon as possible at the United Nations in New York. Senior administration officials telling us today there are no talks scheduled. They do not rule them out, though. Perhaps some contact in the near future, we are told, to watch for, but the administration holding to this bottom line. Says it will talk to North Korea, but only about getting a commitment from North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program. White House officials say until that commitment comes, there can be no talk of any concessions, any economic aid, or any other aid or incentives from the United States -- Fredricka.\\nWHITFIELD: All right, thank you, John King from Washington.

While the Pyongyang government aims angry words at the United States, the Bush administration is sticking to plans of diplomacy. We check in with senior White House correspondent John King -- John.\nJOHN KING, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Fredricka, hello to you. The latest words from North Korea that are of concern to the Bush administration, talk in North Korea that perhaps it will resume missile tests. Tests of missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons. This, of course, on the heels of a decision of the North Korea government to restart a nuclear reactor that is critical to its nuclear weapon's program. North Korea also says it will withdraw from participating in the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. The Bush administration approach under fire back here in the United States. The president has said he is willing to talk with North Korea but not negotiate. Mr. Bush says there will be no concessions, no incentives from the United States that North Korea must agree publicly to abandon the weapons program. Many key Democrats, including Senator Carl Levin of Michigan who is a senior member of the Senate Arms Services Committee say that's a mistake. They say the Bush administration should sit down with North Korea, no conditions.\nSEN. CARL LEVIN (D), MICHIGAN: I think it's wrong, and there ought to be direct dialogue and at a high level. It doesn't mean you're going to capitulate. Doesn't mean you are going to give concessions. All it means is you're going to talk to people to avoid miscalculation, and so they know directly what is on our mind and we can hear from them what is directly on their mind.\nKING: Also some criticism today from some key Republicans. The president has said repeatedly that he has no plans and no intention of any hostile action military action toward North Korea. Senator John McCain of Arizona says heading into any negotiations or any conversations, the president should keep all options on the table, including the prospect of military force.\nSEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: It is a clear and present danger to the United States of America, they've now developed at least two nuclear weapons. If they -- if this situation continues as it is, they will have six or eight more. That gives them an enormous amount of flexibility. They've tested a missile. It could strike Tokyo. And they're developing missiles that can strike the United States of America. The United States needs to take vigorous action with our allies. But if not, on our own.\nKING: The Bush administration maintains it is confident all of this can be resolved peacefully through diplomacy.

The National Rifle Association is a leading voice for gun rights. They share common interests, of course, but it's emerging that they may not always have the same opinions about fighting the change in gun laws.\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Paul Barrett of Bloomberg Businessweek has been talking with gun makers.\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: What is it you think has been overlooked about the - whatever you want to call it - the gun lobby, the gun industry, gun rights advocates, what did you discover?\nPAUL BARRETT: It's becoming almost conventional wisdom that the reason the NRA goes to such extremes is that it is driven by the gun industry. And in fact, that understanding is just incorrect. If anything, it is the NRA that sets the terms of the debate and the gun industry basically obediently follows along.\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: What are some things that the National Rifle Association has said in recent months that have caused people in the gun industry who talked to you to cringe?\nPAUL BARRETT: Well, the most specific thing has been the series of performances by Wayne LaPierre, the CEO and longtime head of the NRA, who has taken the group to what I would describe as a new extreme in terms of its pugnacious stance in the wake of the Newtown Elementary School massacre. And I think many people in the gun industry, given a choice, would not take the conspiratorial sort of paranoid approach that LaPierre specializes in. That said, they are doing nothing to try to deter him - for two reasons. One, they're afraid of the consumer boycotts that the NRA can organize if it chooses. And two, the NRA's hype actually does benefit the gun industry.\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Is that a real possibility, that the NRA could organize a boycott of Smith & Wesson or some other brand of firearm?\nPAUL BARRETT: It's not just a real possibility; it's something that has happened in the past. In 2000, which really was the last time before the current round of debate that we had a live gun control debate at the national level. Smith and Wesson actually tried to step up and arrive at a truce with the Clinton administration and with government officials around the country who were suing the gun industry. And Smith & Wesson agreed to settle those lawsuits and to comply with an unprecedented level of regulation. The result of that was that the NRA, other gun rights groups, encouraged gun buyers to boycott Smith & Wesson. In the space of six to eight months, the company almost went out of business. Plants were shut down, production lines were closed, and ultimately, the company changed ownership, reneged on the settlement and was accepted back into the fold. This is not a theoretical possibility. This is what happens when you cross the NRA.\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Are there specific reforms - if we want to call them that - that gun manufacturers would sign on to if the NRA was not in the way of them doing so?\nPAUL BARRETT: It's more question of whether they would object. One of the main proposals pending before Congress, and in fact, the White House has identified this as its top priority, is to make the background check system comprehensive, so that it would be legally required for all gun transactions to go through some type of computerized background check.\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Mm-hmm.\nPAUL BARRETT: In fact, the gun industry is basically agnostic on that point. It's not that they're going to stand up and cheer in favor of it, but almost their entire stock and trade is already done through the licensed background check system. So the gun industry would just basically stand by and say very little if it were purely up to them. But they're not going to stand up and get into a fight with Wayne LaPierre in public.\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Paul Barrett of Bloomberg Businessweek, thanks very much.\nPAUL BARRETT: My pleasure.

If anything, it is the NRA that sets the terms of the debate and the gun industry basically obediently follows along.\\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: What are some things that the National Rifle Association has said in recent months that have caused people in the gun industry who talked to you to cringe?\\nPAUL BARRETT: Well, the most specific thing has been the series of performances by Wayne LaPierre, the CEO and longtime head of the NRA, who has taken the group to what I would describe as a new extreme in terms of its pugnacious stance in the wake of the Newtown Elementary School massacre. And I think many people in the gun industry, given a choice, would not take the conspiratorial sort of paranoid approach that LaPierre specializes in. That said, they are doing nothing to try to deter him - for two reasons. One, they're afraid of the consumer boycotts that the NRA can organize if it chooses. And two, the NRA's hype actually does benefit the gun industry.\\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Is that a real possibility, that the NRA could organize a boycott of Smith & Wesson or some other brand of firearm?\\nPAUL BARRETT: It's not just a real possibility; it's something that has happened in the past. In 2000, which really was the last time before the current round of debate that we had a live gun control debate at the national level. Smith and Wesson actually tried to step up and arrive at a truce with the Clinton administration and with government officials around the country who were suing the gun industry. And Smith & Wesson agreed to settle those lawsuits and to comply with an unprecedented level of regulation. The result of that was that the NRA, other gun rights groups, encouraged gun buyers to boycott Smith & Wesson. In the space of six to eight months, the company almost went out of business. Plants were shut down, production lines were closed, and ultimately, the company changed ownership, reneged on the settlement and was accepted back into the fold. This is not a theoretical possibility. This is what happens when you cross the NRA.\\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Are there specific reforms - if we want to call them that - that gun manufacturers would sign on to if the NRA was not in the way of them doing so?\\nPAUL BARRETT: It's more question of whether they would object. One of the main proposals pending before Congress, and in fact, the White House has identified this as its top priority, is to make the background check system comprehensive, so that it would be legally required for all gun transactions to go through some type of computerized background check.\\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Mm-hmm.\\nPAUL BARRETT: In fact, the gun industry is basically agnostic on that point. It's not that they're going to stand up and cheer in favor of it, but almost their entire stock and trade is already done through the licensed background check system. So the gun industry would just basically stand by and say very little if it were purely up to them. But they're not going to stand up and get into a fight with Wayne LaPierre in public.\\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Paul Barrett of Bloomberg Businessweek, thanks very much.\\nPAUL BARRETT: My pleasure. Thanks for having me.\\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: This is NPR News.\""

He's an analyst on Iran for the International Crisis Group. And he's spent a lot of time studying the influence of Iran in Iraq.\nMICHELE NORRIS, host: And Karim Sadjadpour joins us now in the studio. So glad that you're with us.\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): My pleasure, Michele.\nMICHELE NORRIS, host: First, Karim, tell us about this branch of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard known as the Quds Force. Who are they and what are their responsibilities?\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): The Quds Force - Quds in Persian or in Arabic means Jerusalem. And it's a very elite branch of the Revolutionary Guards. We don't know exactly how many they are in number, but I think we're talking about hundreds, not thousands. Revolutionary Guards altogether are about 150,000 troops. And they're a very elite branch, I think they have military activities that would compare to something like the Navy Seals, very elitely trained.\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): On the other hand, they're also conducting intelligence operations that maybe are akin to more along the lines of the CIA, or the FBI. And the Quds Forces in Iraq are not just operating in terms of the military power and flexing their muscles in that sense, but they're also operating a lot under the scenes, behind the scenes in terms of intelligence, buying support in Iraq, conducting kind of social capital experiments, funding mosques, funding clinics, things like that. So they're very much a versatile force in Iraq.\nMICHELE NORRIS, host: Almost sounds like - you mentioned the Navy Seals. Almost sounds a bit like the CIA if you were trying to think of an American equivalent.\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): Well, they're a combination of a lot of these things, because they - I think they are trained militarily, but at the same time they're trained to conduct these intelligence operations as well. So I think something akin to an elite fighting force which also has this intelligence sound to it as well.\nMICHELE NORRIS, host: There is also the question of control. We heard the president today say it's not clear exactly who picked up the phone and told them to do what they did. And some U.S. intelligence officials say that the Quds Force would not be doing this kind of thing unless they had approval from top leaders in Tehran. Does that make sense to you?\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): What's an extent that does make sense? I mean if we look at the Iranian Constitution similar to the U.S. Constitution, the president of the United States is commander in chief of the U.S. military. Similarly in Iran, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, has constitutional jurisdiction over the Revolutionary Guards. And the Quds Forces are a branch of the Revolutionary Guards, so hierarchically if you look at it, the Quds Forces ultimately do not report to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): But also, we have to be clear that this is a very dysfunctional regime in Tehran. You have many different types of personalities, many different types of institutions. It's not a dictatorship like Saddam Hussein's Iraq was, where you have one person who's ruling by decree. Iran - the way decisions are made in Iran is very much a consensus building process, so there's an element of dysfunctionality that different institutions of the regime are conducting.\nMICHELE NORRIS, host: If Iran does want to exercise broad influence throughout the region, where else is the Quds Forces are operating right now?\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): Well, in Lebanon, as well. There's been a lot of accusations in the past that Quds Forces has trained Hezbollah. This was an accusation that the Israelis made during the Lebanon war in the summer of 2006. And there's also, you know, concern that Iran has these Quds Forces and Revolutionary Guards well placed in some of the Shiite communities throughout the Persian Gulf. So for example, Saudi Arabia is a very, you know, key country, and the bulk of Saudi Arabia's energy reserves are in the eastern province.\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): And the eastern province happens to have a Shiite majority population. And there is a concern, for example, that if Saudi Arabia somehow complicit in taking on Iran, if Saudi Arabia joins the United States in confronting Iran's nuclear posture, that Iran have capability to really make life difficult in Saudi's eastern province through these Quds Forces collaborating with local Shiite Saudi population.\nMICHELE NORRIS, host: Karim, thanks so much for coming in to talk to us.\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): Thank you, Michele.\nMICHELE NORRIS, host: Karim Sadjadpour is an analyst on Iran for the International Crisis Group.",

Almost sounds a bit like the CIA if you were trying to think of an American equivalent.\\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): Well, they're a combination of a lot of these things, because they - I think they are trained militarily, but at the same time they're trained to conduct these intelligence operations as well. So I think something akin to an elite fighting force which also has this intelligence sound to it as well.\\nMICHELE NORRIS, host: There is also the question of control. We heard the president today say it's not clear exactly who picked up the phone and told them to do what they did. And some U.S. intelligence officials say that the Quds Force would not be doing this kind of thing unless they had approval from top leaders in Tehran. Does that make sense to you?\\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): What's an extent that does make sense? I mean if we look at the Iranian Constitution similar to the U.S. Constitution, the president of the United States is commander in chief of the U.S. military. Similarly in Iran, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, has constitutional jurisdiction over the Revolutionary Guards. And the Quds Forces are a branch of the Revolutionary Guards, so hierarchically if you look at it, the Quds Forces ultimately do not report to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.\\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): But also, we have to be clear that this is a very dysfunctional regime in Tehran. You have many different types of personalities, many different types of institutions. It's not a dictatorship like Saddam Hussein's Iraq was, where you have one person who's ruling by decree. Iran - the way decisions are made in Iran is very much a consensus building process, so there's an element of dysfunctionality that different institutions of the regime are conducting.\\nMICHELE NORRIS, host: If Iran does want to exercise broad influence throughout the region, where else is the Quds Forces are operating right now?\\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): Well, in Lebanon, as well. There's been a lot of accusations in the past that Quds Forces has trained Hezbollah. This was an accusation that the Israelis made during the Lebanon war in the summer of 2006. And there's also, you know, concern that Iran has these Quds Forces and Revolutionary Guards well placed in some of the Shiite communities throughout the Persian Gulf. So for example, Saudi Arabia is a very, you know, key country, and the bulk of Saudi Arabia's energy reserves are in the eastern province.\\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): And the eastern province happens to have a Shiite majority population. And there is a concern, for example, that if Saudi Arabia somehow complicit in taking on Iran, if Saudi Arabia joins the United States in confronting Iran's nuclear posture, that Iran have capability to really make life difficult in Saudi's eastern province through these Quds Forces collaborating with local Shiite Saudi population.\\nMICHELE NORRIS, host: Karim, thanks so much for coming in to talk to us.\\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): Thank you, Michele.\\nMICHELE NORRIS, host: Karim Sadjadpour is an analyst on Iran for the International Crisis Group.\""

Please be gentle. This first time I've been here talking about this. Introduce yourself. Oh, I'm sorry. My name is Brad Farmer, and I'm in the finance department. The city here. We're looking currently at the second quarter collections for sales tax that actually were sold and collected in the first quarter for last year. So just to remind you, I know two weeks ago you were reminded that there was a lag period of 90 days. This is the second one that we received. One of the nice parts about this current one is that we're at 40%. Compared to last year, we were at 32%. So we're a little bit ahead. One of the questions that did arise last time was there was a $313,000 one time adjustment. The entities that were adjusted to actually are on our normal tax roll. So that will continue to come forward. Second side you're seeing there is the best part is for the last 13 quarters were up 28%. And it seems to be a pretty solid trend line.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Okay. But.\nSpeaker 5: In the. Trends that we see, we basically see strong sales pretty much across the board in the top 25 are really strong and top 100 continue to be very aggressive. Business and industry continue to lead the way. Order by restaurants in general. Consumer goods. Probably the biggest thing that we're going to have coming, I think, is going to be the online retail sales, which are going to come from the county pool. That seems to be the fastest growing area is me. Unless we can get more retailers in here and this is going to continue to probably be our fastest growing pool. This graph here shows you basically the industries. And as I said, business and industry restaurants and consumer goods tend to be really strong. The one concern that I would have if there's anything is going to be on fuel and as you noticed, the prices, I think when we were here last time, we're down about $0.25. Tesoro just had a strike, so prices jumped again, $0.30 in the last two weeks. And that all depends on what happens in the fracking industry and as the prices go up and down per barrel. But I think this is where we're going to see some loss in the next year, probably as well as HTL, who handles all of our sales tax. They also suggested that this might be the case. And then once again, we are still at the bottom of the chart as far as sales tax goes. The countywide tax, or this was another question that came up last time was 9%. In San Leandro, it's 9.25. Albany is 9.5 and else redo is 9.5. Those are all special taxes that their council along the voters represented and passed to get on to their ballots. We don't currently have that.

I is recommendation to approve the amended and restated maintenance and cost sharing agreement between the City of Alameda and Alameda West Lagoon Homeowners Association.\nSpeaker 3: It.\nSpeaker 0: All right, Steph, do you want to maybe just introduce this item? But someone introduced this item before. That's a5e.\nSpeaker 3: Uh huh. Yeah.\nSpeaker 5: Good afternoon, Madam Mirror. Members of the City Council. Members of the audience. My name is Enrico Pinnick. I'm the assistant city of assistant city attorney for the city of Alameda. Normally, staff would present this item, but I worked on it and I think I can answer your questions just by way of general background. This is an agreement that basically brings up to date an existing relationship that we've had with the Lagoon Housing, the Lagoon Homeowners Association, as you may know, and I'm sorry, I'm speaking somewhat generally. I didn't I wasn't quite prepared to.\nSpeaker 0: Write this item just to give us a little bit of information. So we knew.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 5: As, as, you know, the the the guns are manmade. And also, although they serve a recreational purpose for the homeowners that surround the lagoon, they also provide a public utility in the sense that we use the lagoons to help capture stormwater and then meter it out into the bay. This agreement is a maintenance agreement, and it basically sets forth the relationship between the city and the homeowner's association as it relates to certain maintenance obligations for the use of the lagoons for that public purpose. This relationship has been ongoing for a long period of time, and the old relationship, the old agreement expired. And what we were trying to do through this amended and restated agreement today was to, one, bring the agreement up to certain city standards as it relates to insurance and indemnification. And also to clarify some things that we have been we being the city and the homeowner's association have been doing as a matter of practice, but hadn't actually been addressed in the contract with that is sort of an overview that would conclude my presentation and I'd be happy to answer any questions that you have.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Well, we have a public speaker, so I just going to go ahead and call the speaker, if that's all right. I appreciate that. Okay. Karen Butcher.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening, Madam Mayor, Vice Mayor, council members, staff and ladies and gentlemen, Karen Bootle here and I am the Secretary of the Alameda West Lagoon Homeowners Association. And I wanted to come here and in particular, and I apologize to Mr. Penick for not warning him, but in particular to thank the city and the city staff for working with us to update and restate this agreement. The agreement was originally signed in 1964. So the homeowners association and we are a volunteer board and the city in particular public works and occasionally members of your your city attorney's office have been working together for over half a century. This is a public and private partnership. And there's so much talk these days about public and private partnership. I just wanted to stand up and say, hey, we got one, it's working and we hope to make it continue to work. So once again, we really appreciate the relationship we have, in particular with our city works, the engineering department, the maintenance folks, and I hope that continues.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. I appreciate you coming on and sharing that. We've been working together since 1964 on this. It's wonderful.\nSpeaker 3: Those were built.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you for adding that. So the lagoons were built in 57. For those of you that didn't hear her.\nSpeaker 7: We do like emotional.\nSpeaker 0: Remember?\nSpeaker 5: I had a quick comment. Thank you, Madam Mayor. Thank you, Karen, for coming. You and I had a little conversation about this at the League of Women Voters. Meet your elected officials last week. And what I wanted to add that that Karen didn't add was that they do have a homeowners association and they are looking for volunteers . They have two open spots.

My name is Enrico Pinnick. I'm the assistant city of assistant city attorney for the city of Alameda.

I didn't I wasn't quite prepared to.\\nSpeaker 0: Write this item just to give us a little bit of information. So we knew.\\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\\nSpeaker 5: As, as, you know, the the the guns are manmade. And also, although they serve a recreational purpose for the homeowners that surround the lagoon, they also provide a public utility in the sense that we use the lagoons to help capture stormwater and then meter it out into the bay. This agreement is a maintenance agreement, and it basically sets forth the relationship between the city and the homeowner's association as it relates to certain maintenance obligations for the use of the lagoons for that public purpose. This relationship has been ongoing for a long period of time, and the old relationship, the old agreement expired. And what we were trying to do through this amended and restated agreement today was to, one, bring the agreement up to certain city standards as it relates to insurance and indemnification. And also to clarify some things that we have been we being the city and the homeowner's association have been doing as a matter of practice, but hadn't actually been addressed in the contract with that is sort of an overview that would conclude my presentation and I'd be happy to answer any questions that you have.\\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.

And I wanted to come here and in particular, and I apologize to Mr. Penick for not warning him, but in particular to thank the city and the city staff for working with us to update and restate this agreement. The agreement was originally signed in 1964. So the homeowners association and we are a volunteer board and the city in particular public works and occasionally members of your your city attorney's office have been working together for over half a century. This is a public and private partnership. And there's so much talk these days about public and private partnership. I just wanted to stand up and say, hey, we got one, it's working and we hope to make it continue to work. So once again, we really appreciate the relationship we have, in particular with our city works, the engineering department, the maintenance folks, and I hope that continues.\\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. I appreciate you coming on and sharing that. We've been working together since 1964 on this. It's wonderful.\\nSpeaker 3: Those were built.\\nSpeaker 0: Thank you for adding that.

I think that motion carries that was three a an hour here in regards to three B, which is the recommendation to accept the investment report for the quarter ending June 30th, 2017.\nSpeaker 1: And Kevin Kennedy is here. Can talk about it. And Elena Adair. Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\nSpeaker 2: You're better than at the moment.\nSpeaker 0: So thank you for being here this evening.\nSpeaker 2: Of course. Thank, Alina. My name's Kevin Kennedy. I'm the city treasurer. Madame Mayor. Happy belated birthday. Thank you. City Council. Just to give you a quick update on Wells Fargo, as the report indicates, we did sell the positions that we had in Wells Fargo as of June 30th. So the portfolio does not hold. Any Wells Fargo securities in it, which was the the direction we got from counsel. Last spring.\nSpeaker 0: And can you clarify, was there any loss to the city for doing that?\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you'll see. On page two of the report, uh, it lists out three bonds that we sold to them. We sold it at a small gain. One, we sold at a loss. Net net, it was about a $2,000 loss, which sounds like a lot of money, but it was a million and a half dollars worth of bonds . So if you take it as a percentage, I think it's about a 10th of a percent. So it wasn't it wasn't a big financial event for the portfolio at all. But it does divest us from from the Wells Fargo investments.\nSpeaker 0: And then, has that money been reinvested?\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Yes. And Wells Fargo is on the you should call it the no buy list and until further indication. So our managers are aware of that.\nSpeaker 0: And do you believe that you're able to find comparable investments so that the long term will not be a financial loss to the city to have done that?\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. You know, the value that they sold at is a factor of interest rates. So, you know, in theory, the interest rates were a little bit higher than when they bought the bonds. So they probably turned around and bought another bond with the interest rates high. I don't think that's a big issue and it's just one issue. Granted, as we've talked about, the the universe of bonds that we can invest in because of our strict credit rating requirements and stuff is fairly limited. But taking one issue or out of that mix probably doesn't affect the portfolio in the long run.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Any other questions from vice mayor?\nSpeaker 4: It's not really a question. I just wanted to say thank you to both you and Elena for your work on this. And, you know, I think that it's tremendous that not only did we say we were going to do something, but we've actually taken action and we did it in a way that was fiscally savvy for our city. So thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Absolutely. And I want to also echo that it was commending our council for moving forward on this item. I think it was important. Yes, I believe it was a referral, yes. From vice mayor and member already. Yes. So thank you. All right. So thank you very much. And now do we have a motion to accept three?\nSpeaker 4: I'll make the motion to accept a3p second.\nSpeaker 0: All those in favor I motion carries unanimously. Thank you. I will now adjourn this special FCIC meeting and we will now open the regular city council meeting.\nSpeaker 1: Raqqa has been noted.

Last spring.\\nSpeaker 0: And can you clarify, was there any loss to the city for doing that?\\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you'll see. On page two of the report, uh, it lists out three bonds that we sold to them. We sold it at a small gain. One, we sold at a loss. Net net, it was about a $2,000 loss, which sounds like a lot of money, but it was a million and a half dollars worth of bonds . So if you take it as a percentage, I think it's about a 10th of a percent. So it wasn't it wasn't a big financial event for the portfolio at all. But it does divest us from from the Wells Fargo investments.\\nSpeaker 0: And then, has that money been reinvested?\\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Yes. And Wells Fargo is on the you should call it the no buy list and until further indication. So our managers are aware of that.\\nSpeaker 0: And do you believe that you're able to find comparable investments so that the long term will not be a financial loss to the city to have done that?\\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. You know, the value that they sold at is a factor of interest rates. So, you know, in theory, the interest rates were a little bit higher than when they bought the bonds. So they probably turned around and bought another bond with the interest rates high. I don't think that's a big issue and it's just one issue. Granted, as we've talked about, the the universe of bonds that we can invest in because of our strict credit rating requirements and stuff is fairly limited. But taking one issue or out of that mix probably doesn't affect the portfolio in the long run.\\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Any other questions from vice mayor?\\nSpeaker 4: It's not really a question. I just wanted to say thank you to both you and Elena for your work on this.

This referral came from Councilmember Ody and Brody.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you for being at such a late hour. I'll try to be brief so we can get out of here. So just as a little bit of background, MTC, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission recently contracted with a company to operate the bike share program and expanded from 700 bicycles to 7000 bicycles are doing this in Oakland, San Francisco , San Jose, Emeryville and Berkeley. Unfortunately, Alameda is not part of that. I know the MBC was looking to expand it to other cities and I would just like to get the sense of the council to instruct staff that if MTC is still looking to expand this or if they're looking to expand this in the future, you know that Alameda make an effort to participate because I think we really are of all of the cities in the Bay Area the most bikeable and you know bike sharing for those that don't know it like city car share where you can pick up a car, you know, take it somewhere and drop it off. Same thing with bike sharing and get on a bike. I think somebody even mentioned it not at the last meeting, but in the previous meeting. You know, that they can just hop on a bike, you know, ride over to Alameda Point, drop it off, you know, pick up another one later. So I know it's not like the biggest issue facing the council today and this month, but I think it's something that, you know, given our our geography and our topography as being flat and the way all of Alameda loves biking and reducing car emissions, that is something that we consider being a part of in the future.\nSpeaker 0: Member Ashcraft.\nSpeaker 4: I'm a big fan of city bike share programs. When I visit my kids in Washington, D.C., I pack my helmet and I use the city bike share there, and it's really reasonably priced. And I would also love to see allow me to be a part of it. I wondered if this is something we wanted to present to the Transportation Commission, to perhaps even study and put together a proposal for MTC just because they handle those sorts of things. And but I certainly agree with Councilmember Ody that we are a flat city. We've got the topography, we are adding more bike lanes all the time. And we constantly are trying to get people out of their cars and onto alternate means of transportation, both to reduce our traffic, to improve their health and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which is our responsibility as elected leaders. But I'm just wondering whether this might appropriately reside with the Transportation Commission.\nSpeaker 3: So I think any anything that we do on this matter would clearly end up not end up there, but find their way there and then on to the council. So we would be absolutely sure to include the Transportation Commission on anything we do on this.\nSpeaker 0: Though, could staff look at and so I don't know how MTC arrived at what cities or if cities had to pay any moneys to participate, could start, look into it and then just maybe report back to us or how would staff propose we go forward on the site and.\nSpeaker 3: We would definitely want to take a look at how they identified the cities. And also, was there a cost to participating? And if there was, how much and do we think that we could you know, obviously, if there's some monetary implication, we would want to talk to the council about that, too. So we'll bring it back in and take a look at, you know, we need to analyze the program and how they identified the cities.\nSpeaker 0: And I want to thank member Ody for bringing this to him as a referral. I think that's a great idea.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Member de SAC.\nSpeaker 6: Yes, I think we should certainly take a look at this and as part of the review of it, also make sure to involve outfits that at this point in time rent out bikes in Alameda, of which there might be several. Particularly one on an offshore onshore island drive near the McDonald's restaurant. So I'm sure it's not an either or situation, but if we just make sure that we work it in, you know, everyone can turn out a winner.\nSpeaker 5: And Rudy in the staff report. You know, there were a lot of different, you know, issues like, for example, not taking away parking meters, space, things like that. So a lot of this has to be evaluated. But it would be nice if Alameda. Yeah. Could be at least at the table and and be one of the possible future sites for this.\nSpeaker 0: That concludes that item in. Yes. You're good. All right.

This referral came from Councilmember Ody and Brody.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you for being at such a late hour. I'll try to be brief so we can get out of here. So just as a little bit of background, MTC, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission recently contracted with a company to operate the bike share program and expanded from 700 bicycles to 7000 bicycles are doing this in Oakland, San Francisco , San Jose, Emeryville and Berkeley. Unfortunately, Alameda is not part of that. I know the MBC was looking to expand it to other cities and I would just like to get the sense of the council to instruct staff that if MTC is still looking to expand this or if they're looking to expand this in the future, you know that Alameda make an effort to participate because I think we really are of all of the cities in the Bay Area the most bikeable and you know bike sharing for those that don't know it like city car share where you can pick up a car, you know, take it somewhere and drop it off. Same thing with bike sharing and get on a bike. I think somebody even mentioned it not at the last meeting, but in the previous meeting. You know, that they can just hop on a bike, you know, ride over to Alameda Point, drop it off, you know, pick up another one later. So I know it's not like the biggest issue facing the council today and this month, but I think it's something that, you know, given our our geography and our topography as being flat and the way all of Alameda loves biking and reducing car emissions, that is something that we consider being a part of in the future.\nSpeaker 0: Member Ashcraft.\nSpeaker 4: I'm a big fan of city bike share programs. When I visit my kids in Washington, D.C., I pack my helmet and I use the city bike share there, and it's really reasonably priced. And I would also love to see allow me to be a part of it. I wondered if this is something we wanted to present to the Transportation Commission, to perhaps even study and put together a proposal for MTC just because they handle those sorts of things. And but I certainly agree with Councilmember Ody that we are a flat city. We've got the topography, we are adding more bike lanes all the time. And we constantly are trying to get people out of their cars and onto alternate means of transportation, both to reduce our traffic, to improve their health and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which is our responsibility as elected leaders. But I'm just wondering whether this might appropriately reside with the Transportation Commission.\nSpeaker 3: So I think any anything that we do on this matter would clearly end up not end up there, but find their way there and then on to the council. So we would be absolutely sure to include the Transportation Commission on anything we do on this.\nSpeaker 0: Though, could staff look at and so I don't know how MTC arrived at what cities or if cities had to pay any moneys to participate, could start, look into it and then just maybe report back to us or how would staff propose we go forward on the site and.\nSpeaker 3: We would definitely want to take a look at how they identified the cities. And also, was there a cost to participating? And if there was, how much and do we think that we could you know, obviously, if there's some monetary implication, we would want to talk to the council about that, too. So we'll bring it back in and take a look at, you know, we need to analyze the program and how they identified the cities.\nSpeaker 0: And I want to thank member Ody for bringing this to him as a referral. I think that's a great idea.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Member de SAC.\nSpeaker 6: Yes, I think we should certainly take a look at this and as part of the review of it, also make sure to involve outfits that at this point in time rent out bikes in Alameda, of which there might be several. Particularly one on an offshore onshore island drive near the McDonald's restaurant. So I'm sure it's not an either or situation, but if we just make sure that we work it in, you know, everyone can turn out a winner.\nSpeaker 5: And Rudy in the staff report. You know, there were a lot of different, you know, issues like, for example, not taking away parking meters, space, things like that. So a lot of this has to be evaluated. But it would be nice if Alameda. Yeah. Could be at least at the table and and be one of the possible future sites for this.\nSpeaker 0: That concludes that item in. Yes. You're good. All right. We're going to move on then.\nSpeaker 6: I mean.\nSpeaker 0: You had direction with that.\nSpeaker 4: There's consensus.",

But a lot of the support that the city has received from HUD over the past years have really flatlined, especially in in when we think about inflation.

And we have but I transient populations are immigrants and that challenge could result in us getting more resources into these HUD block grants that we receive. So just something for the Council to explore because I know that something that others have elevated and that's something I've expressed concern about too, and how it affects how much money, how much we receive in these important block grants that not only help with housing, but also economic development and small business development as well.

Councilmember Flynn, go ahead with your comments on resolution 159, please.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Madam President. I don't want anybody up here on the dais to faint when I say that I am going to vote yes on a contract that includes red light cameras that do not work because they also contain the renewal of our photo radar speeding van program, which I think is essential for safety in our neighborhoods . I think it's disappointing that the agencies have combined the two because, well, just last week we were in a meeting with Dotti and some people from Harvey Park about improvements on Yale Avenue between federal between Irving and Sheridan. And one of the members of the public remarked that the traffic signals along there, the other three at Irving, Lowell and Raleigh, there seem to be more red light running at the one in Lowell. And so I noted for everybody present that that's because the yellow time at the one on.\nSpeaker 0: Lowell.\nSpeaker 4: Is inconsistent with the other two. That's why you don't see red light running at the other two as much as you do at the one at Raleigh. So I think it's disappointing that the city agencies seem intent on perpetuating red light running when we know there's a way to effectively eliminate all but intentional and distracted driving cases of red light running, leaving in place dangerous situations where we've identified intersections with a high level of red light running, leaving in place the traffic engineering shortcoming that induces red light running, which is necessary to make red light cameras profitable. I think borderlines on on negligence when there are accidents. We know. For instance, in California, where the state legislature adopted requirements for cities that use cameras to follow a certain formula for setting the yellow change interval, the timing of the yellow light. We know that cities up and down the state have removed their cameras because they no longer had significant red light running. And I mentioned when we when we postponed these contracts about a year or so ago, the case of Loma Linda, California, where one intersection averaged about 250 violations a month, that one approach on one of their streets and Loma Linda, 250 a month. And when they added a little bit of yellow time to the two, the traffic signal violations went down to six per month. And as I said a year ago, how many folks would like to stand at an intersection in Denver and not see anything but one violation every five days at a at a red light? But the agencies seem intent on on combining and packaging the red light cameras with the what I believe is the the positive nature of this contract, which is the photo radar speeding than we are needlessly fining drivers who are caught in our own engineering deficiencies that we are refusing to adequately fix. Since 2008, when this program started, all four of our camera intersections better enforced. And I think this is this is one of the reasons I'm voting for it, by the way, because this new contract will allow us to remove the cameras from those locations and move them around. But they've been at the same four locations ever since 2008. And all of those are on corridors that serve our underserved and marginalized neighborhoods. Three of the four primarily impact commuters from the West Side, including my district. When they come in on Sixth Avenue and go up Lincoln and they return home on Eighth Avenue through Speer. Three times a day, commuters from my area who work downtown go through these. And then the last one, the fourth one is up in on Northeast Park Hill and Central Park, borderline on Quebec, also both with all these locations. Affecting those neighborhoods. But otherwise, people who might live in southeast Denver or South Denver or central Denver, they might not even know we have red light cameras in them because they don't have the opportunity to go through them. When you look at the data that was provided to me by the department, police department. There has been since we instituted this program. There's been a 92% increase in red light running through violations from 2014 through last year. 92%. The data on accidents is also on crashes is also very ambivalent because there's such a short dataset from before we started the program in 2008. There's very little data just two or three years, and you can see that the number of T-Bone accidents from year to year might be the same as they were before the red light cameras went in. I think it's an abject failure when we know. From the California experience. That setting the yellow time properly and appropriately for the traffic conditions virtually eliminates red light running. As I said, the only saving grace is that will be able to, for me in this contract is that we'll be able to finally move them from sixth in Kalamazoo and from eighth and Speer and sixth and Lincoln and 36 and Quebec and put to put them in some other parts of town for a change. Instead of draining the wallets of drivers who otherwise are driving safely but are caught in our engineering shortcomings. Thank you, Madam President.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilmember Flynn.

Councilmember Flynn, go ahead with your comments on resolution 159, please.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Madam President. I don't want anybody up here on the dais to faint when I say that I am going to vote yes on a contract that includes red light cameras that do not work because they also contain the renewal of our photo radar speeding van program, which I think is essential for safety in our neighborhoods . I think it's disappointing that the agencies have combined the two because, well, just last week we were in a meeting with Dotti and some people from Harvey Park about improvements on Yale Avenue between federal between Irving and Sheridan. And one of the members of the public remarked that the traffic signals along there, the other three at Irving, Lowell and Raleigh, there seem to be more red light running at the one in Lowell. And so I noted for everybody present that that's because the yellow time at the one on.\nSpeaker 0: Lowell.\nSpeaker 4: Is inconsistent with the other two. That's why you don't see red light running at the other two as much as you do at the one at Raleigh. So I think it's disappointing that the city agencies seem intent on perpetuating red light running when we know there's a way to effectively eliminate all but intentional and distracted driving cases of red light running, leaving in place dangerous situations where we've identified intersections with a high level of red light running, leaving in place the traffic engineering shortcoming that induces red light running, which is necessary to make red light cameras profitable. I think borderlines on on negligence when there are accidents. We know. For instance, in California, where the state legislature adopted requirements for cities that use cameras to follow a certain formula for setting the yellow change interval, the timing of the yellow light. We know that cities up and down the state have removed their cameras because they no longer had significant red light running. And I mentioned when we when we postponed these contracts about a year or so ago, the case of Loma Linda, California, where one intersection averaged about 250 violations a month, that one approach on one of their streets and Loma Linda, 250 a month. And when they added a little bit of yellow time to the two, the traffic signal violations went down to six per month. And as I said a year ago, how many folks would like to stand at an intersection in Denver and not see anything but one violation every five days at a at a red light? But the agencies seem intent on on combining and packaging the red light cameras with the what I believe is the the positive nature of this contract, which is the photo radar speeding than we are needlessly fining drivers who are caught in our own engineering deficiencies that we are refusing to adequately fix. Since 2008, when this program started, all four of our camera intersections better enforced. And I think this is this is one of the reasons I'm voting for it, by the way, because this new contract will allow us to remove the cameras from those locations and move them around. But they've been at the same four locations ever since 2008. And all of those are on corridors that serve our underserved and marginalized neighborhoods. Three of the four primarily impact commuters from the West Side, including my district. When they come in on Sixth Avenue and go up Lincoln and they return home on Eighth Avenue through Speer. Three times a day, commuters from my area who work downtown go through these. And then the last one, the fourth one is up in on Northeast Park Hill and Central Park, borderline on Quebec, also both with all these locations. Affecting those neighborhoods. But otherwise, people who might live in southeast Denver or South Denver or central Denver, they might not even know we have red light cameras in them because they don't have the opportunity to go through them. When you look at the data that was provided to me by the department, police department. There has been since we instituted this program. There's been a 92% increase in red light running through violations from 2014 through last year. 92%. The data on accidents is also on crashes is also very ambivalent because there's such a short dataset from before we started the program in 2008. There's very little data just two or three years, and you can see that the number of T-Bone accidents from year to year might be the same as they were before the red light cameras went in. I think it's an abject failure when we know. From the California experience. That setting the yellow time properly and appropriately for the traffic conditions virtually eliminates red light running. As I said, the only saving grace is that will be able to, for me in this contract is that we'll be able to finally move them from sixth in Kalamazoo and from eighth and Speer and sixth and Lincoln and 36 and Quebec and put to put them in some other parts of town for a change. Instead of draining the wallets of drivers who otherwise are driving safely but are caught in our engineering shortcomings. Thank you, Madam President.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilmember Flynn. And see no other speakers in the queue. We'll go ahead and move. Move forward on the agenda. Madam Secretary, would you please put the next item up on our screens?

You may remember that you voted last year to approve the Denver preschool tax for another decade, I believe.

And in this case, we I think I'm looking at David, I think we got it right on the sales tax amount, but we were a little low in what the city would take in overall. And so what that means is we need your permission again, because we told you what we thought we were going to take in. We hope that you will tell us again that we should keep the money that we collected for the preschool and use it to get kids head start in life and get them learning their ABCs and safe and quality child care during their start before school.

At some point, I know it's probably not this particular item, but I would love a report back on what some of the costs have been. I know initially when we wanted to deploy. Body worn cameras. We talked a little bit about the cost of responding to praise and things of that nature. So, Chief, this will probably be a future item, which is for you to think about. Now that we've been using body worn cameras since 2016, I'd love to know what the costs, actual actual costs are as opposed to what we thought they would be in terms of the cost to the city. I think that's something that's worth a report back at some point.\\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Councilwoman. We can definitely do that and put something together to bring back.\\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.

National Teen Dating, Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month is an effort to raise awareness about abuse in teen relationships and promote programs that prevent it during the month of February. Unfortunately, dating violence among teens is more common than most people know, according to a recent all national recent national survey. One in ten teens reported being hit or physically hurt, hurt by purpose or hurt on purpose by a boyfriend or girlfriend once in the last 12 months. In addition, one in four teenagers have been in a relationship where a partner is verbally abusive. By supporting the National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month, that's that's a mouthful. We as a city can bring awareness to the issue on a local level and demonstrate our commitment to fostering and supporting a healthier community for all. And we're going to hear during public comment from Candi Lewis, executive director of the Positive Results Corporation. Ms.. Lewis will share with us what her organization is doing to help address teen teen dating violence and how we can support their efforts. And with that, I'll move to move the item.\nSpeaker 1: It's a motion in a second, Councilwoman Gonzalez.\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Thank you, Councilmember Richardson, for bringing this forward. I think it's really important we make sure that we're talking about teen dating violence, both traditional and also via social media and other formats. It's really important. Our teens are certainly the future, and we want to make sure that, you know, that this council is very supportive of of what you're doing. And hopefully, if you are going through anything, you can seek support. But I look forward to hearing from the public and hearing a little bit more about about this issue. But let's stay on this. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Any public comment on the item? Seeing nonmembers, please cast your votes. I didn't see over there.\nSpeaker 9: I.\nSpeaker 1: Let's let's let that lady make a few comments.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Mayor Garcia, Councilmember Richardson and the esteemed council members. My name is Candy Lewis, and I am the executive director of the Positive Results Corporation. We are a nonprofit, and our mission is to address teen dating violence and sexual assault in youth and communities of color. Teen dating violence is an epidemic. And the numbers that you've heard are just reported. The reported numbers are dismal, but the actual numbers are even worse right now. 90 every 90 seconds, a girl in the United States is assaulted. But that's only reported. That's a girl this over 12 years old. And so we're not really showing those correct numbers, according to our surveys that we have personally done in the last five years. We've had over 2200 people that we've surveyed. 37% were African-American. 43% were Latino, Latina, 9% white, 5% Asian, 33%. Pacific Islander, two Middle Eastern, 2%. Middle Eastern. 48% of youth and young adults have experienced sexual assault, dating and domestic violence by the sixth grade. 60.3% of youth and young adults report being hit, slapped, grabbed, pinch, spit, act, and over 60% didn't realize that they could be in a dating and domestic violence relationship. Teen dating violence looks like physical assault, verbal abuse, emotional mental, physical stalking and of course, cyber. And we thank you very much for bringing this to your to the city's attention. It is a national resolution. And because of your support, we'll be able to bring local work, a local commitment here into the city of Long Beach. There's a lot of work that's already being done, but it's not nearly enough because all of our children are impacted. Violence and abuse actually starts in the womb, and if we do not address it, we are going to have a worse problem. Right now, the numbers are 36% of every pregnant woman is physically assaulted. 36%. If we were to turn around and look at the audience and ask them, how many of you have experienced teen dating violence , domestic violence or sexual assault? I'm sure almost everyone would be because every one of us is impacted by it. If it's not in our family, it is in our neighbors, it's in our children. And so I thank you very much for bringing this to light. We do have additional information that we will be happy to share with you. I also have something for you all. I brought our brochure that talks about the work that we do. We not only address teen dating violence and sexual assault, but we also address bullying healthy relationships. Because if we do not talk about healthy relationships, we won't be talking about any relationships as well. And our organization has been partner with all state foundation to eliminate teen dating violence and sexual assault. And so I have a little something for everyone.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, ma'am. Time to time is up. If you can just leave the stuff for for the clerk. That's for you. Thank you very.\nSpeaker 4: Much. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 1: Any other public comment on this item? Okay.

It is a national resolution. And because of your support, we'll be able to bring local work, a local commitment here into the city of Long Beach. There's a lot of work that's already being done, but it's not nearly enough because all of our children are impacted. Violence and abuse actually starts in the womb, and if we do not address it, we are going to have a worse problem. Right now, the numbers are 36% of every pregnant woman is physically assaulted. 36%. If we were to turn around and look at the audience and ask them, how many of you have experienced teen dating violence , domestic violence or sexual assault? I'm sure almost everyone would be because every one of us is impacted by it. If it's not in our family, it is in our neighbors, it's in our children. And so I thank you very much for bringing this to light. We do have additional information that we will be happy to share with you. I also have something for you all. I brought our brochure that talks about the work that we do. We not only address teen dating violence and sexual assault, but we also address bullying healthy relationships. Because if we do not talk about healthy relationships, we won't be talking about any relationships as well. And our organization has been partner with all state foundation to eliminate teen dating violence and sexual assault. And so I have a little something for everyone.\\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, ma'am.

National Teen Dating, Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month is an effort to raise awareness about abuse in teen relationships and promote programs that prevent it during the month of February. Unfortunately, dating violence among teens is more common than most people know, according to a recent all national recent national survey. One in ten teens reported being hit or physically hurt, hurt by purpose or hurt on purpose by a boyfriend or girlfriend once in the last 12 months. In addition, one in four teenagers have been in a relationship where a partner is verbally abusive. By supporting the National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month, that's that's a mouthful. We as a city can bring awareness to the issue on a local level and demonstrate our commitment to fostering and supporting a healthier community for all. And we're going to hear during public comment from Candi Lewis, executive director of the Positive Results Corporation. Ms.. Lewis will share with us what her organization is doing to help address teen teen dating violence and how we can support their efforts. And with that, I'll move to move the item.\nSpeaker 1: It's a motion in a second, Councilwoman Gonzalez.\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Thank you, Councilmember Richardson, for bringing this forward. I think it's really important we make sure that we're talking about teen dating violence, both traditional and also via social media and other formats. It's really important. Our teens are certainly the future, and we want to make sure that, you know, that this council is very supportive of of what you're doing. And hopefully, if you are going through anything, you can seek support. But I look forward to hearing from the public and hearing a little bit more about about this issue. But let's stay on this.

My name is Candy Lewis, and I am the executive director of the Positive Results Corporation. We are a nonprofit, and our mission is to address teen dating violence and sexual assault in youth and communities of color. Teen dating violence is an epidemic. And the numbers that you've heard are just reported. The reported numbers are dismal, but the actual numbers are even worse right now. 90 every 90 seconds, a girl in the United States is assaulted. But that's only reported. That's a girl this over 12 years old. And so we're not really showing those correct numbers, according to our surveys that we have personally done in the last five years. We've had over 2200 people that we've surveyed. 37% were African-American. 43% were Latino, Latina, 9% white, 5% Asian, 33%. Pacific Islander, two Middle Eastern, 2%.

Recommendation to request the City Manager to work with South Coast Air Quality Management District to report on the impacts of the City of Paramount air quality to Long Beach residents.\nSpeaker 4: Councilmember I'm sorry. Vice Mayor.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Here in Long Beach, we border a number of cities, and in the ninth district border, the cities of Paramount, Bellflower, Bellflower, Lakewood, Compton, and the community of Rancho Dominguez, an unincorporated section of L.A. County. So issues commonly across across commonly cross city boundaries. What's important that we stay up to date on manner matters that can potentially impact our residents? Our request today focused on a recent air quality concern with businesses located in City of Paramount, which are both only about a half mile away from District nine Long Beach neighborhoods. In October 2016, the South Coast Air Quality Management District began investigating two metal processing facilities in the city of Paramount after detecting hexavalent chromium, a potentially cancer causing metal. And in the interests of transparency, we placed this motion on the agenda to request city staff to do our diligence and coordinate with HQ, M.D. and City Paramount to better understand any impacts that this incident has had on our Long Beach residents and their quality of life. So tonight we're beginning that conversation and that discussion and will ask city staff to come back to the City Council with their full findings after engaging HQ, M.D. So we'll start with a brief staff report in a few questions now.\nSpeaker 2: Diana Chang, our manager of Government Affairs. I can talk a little bit about this item.\nSpeaker 3: Vice Mayor, Council and mayor. We are aware that there are concerns that the City of Paramount and accused have around their metal.\nSpeaker 5: Facilities without.\nSpeaker 3: Getting into too much detail on on.\nSpeaker 5: The findings that a Camden Paramount have been.\nSpeaker 3: Discovering. We are willing and interested in working with the Air Quality Management District and our neighbors on figuring out any impacts to Northampton and the city of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And I just have a few questions, Miss Mustang two, and I would hope that the responses could be included in whatever report comes back. I'd like to better understand what hexavalent hexavalent chromium is. I'd like to know the difference between a regular metal shop and the ones that have hexavalent chromium emissions. I know that we have Weber Metals here in Long Beach and Paramount and a number of metal shops that are not necessarily hexavalent chromium emission emitters. And so we want to understand the difference between those two and understand where they where they are that are in Long Beach and close to Long Beach. So we want to understand that and we want to confirm and maybe you can answer this for us now, who is the lead agency that does evaluate potential potential impacts of air quality of businesses that surround Long Beach?\nSpeaker 3: Sure. So the US EPA establishes health based air quality standards that all states must achieve. And in California, the California Clean Air Act also establishes requirements for cities and counties to meet.\nSpeaker 5: It is the company's responsibility for developing plans and regulations to.\nSpeaker 3: Achieve these public health standards by reducing emissions from business and industry. So and it appears that ACME is is the lead on this.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And we have already engaged them, correct?\nSpeaker 3: Yes, that is correct.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And so when do we anticipate to have some report of the findings of that discussion back to city council?\nSpeaker 3: We think we can have something back to you in about 45 days.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Have we spoken with the City of Paramount as well?\nSpeaker 3: Yes. Our office has been in contact with the city manager's office and Paramount.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So and so in 45 days, we'll have a report back. And can that include potential next steps if we do find that there is some impact along beach neighborhoods? Yes, certainly. Well, thank you very much. And so that's my motion to come back in 45 days with a report.\nSpeaker 4: Any other accounts, comments, seen, any public accounts of your anger?\nSpeaker 2: I want to I want to thank Vice Mayor Richardson for bringing this forward. I know how equality is important to his neighborhoods as it is in mine. So I'm glad that you're bringing this forward and I strongly support it.\nSpeaker 4: Katie, public comment CNN. Okay.

So we want to understand that and we want to confirm and maybe you can answer this for us now, who is the lead agency that does evaluate potential potential impacts of air quality of businesses that surround Long Beach?\\nSpeaker 3: Sure. So the US EPA establishes health based air quality standards that all states must achieve. And in California, the California Clean Air Act also establishes requirements for cities and counties to meet.\\nSpeaker 5: It is the company's responsibility for developing plans and regulations to.\\nSpeaker 3: Achieve these public health standards by reducing emissions from business and industry. So and it appears that ACME is is the lead on this.\\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And we have already engaged them, correct?\\nSpeaker 3: Yes, that is correct.\\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And so when do we anticipate to have some report of the findings of that discussion back to city council?\\nSpeaker 3: We think we can have something back to you in about 45 days.\\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Have we spoken with the City of Paramount as well?\\nSpeaker 3: Yes. Our office has been in contact with the city manager's office and Paramount.\\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So and so in 45 days, we'll have a report back. And can that include potential next steps if we do find that there is some impact along beach neighborhoods? Yes, certainly. Well, thank you very much. And so that's my motion to come back in 45 days with a report.\\nSpeaker 4: Any other accounts, comments, seen, any public accounts of your anger?\\nSpeaker 2: I want to I want to thank Vice Mayor Richardson for bringing this forward. I know how equality is important to his neighborhoods as it is in mine. So I'm glad that you're bringing this forward and I strongly support it.\\nSpeaker 4: Katie, public comment CNN. Okay. We'll go ahead and do the this motion for this for this report. Then with consensus, no objection.

Recommendation to request the City Manager to work with South Coast Air Quality Management District to report on the impacts of the City of Paramount air quality to Long Beach residents.\nSpeaker 4: Councilmember I'm sorry. Vice Mayor.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Here in Long Beach, we border a number of cities, and in the ninth district border, the cities of Paramount, Bellflower, Bellflower, Lakewood, Compton, and the community of Rancho Dominguez, an unincorporated section of L.A. County. So issues commonly across across commonly cross city boundaries. What's important that we stay up to date on manner matters that can potentially impact our residents? Our request today focused on a recent air quality concern with businesses located in City of Paramount, which are both only about a half mile away from District nine Long Beach neighborhoods. In October 2016, the South Coast Air Quality Management District began investigating two metal processing facilities in the city of Paramount after detecting hexavalent chromium, a potentially cancer causing metal. And in the interests of transparency, we placed this motion on the agenda to request city staff to do our diligence and coordinate with HQ, M.D. and City Paramount to better understand any impacts that this incident has had on our Long Beach residents and their quality of life. So tonight we're beginning that conversation and that discussion and will ask city staff to come back to the City Council with their full findings after engaging HQ, M.D. So we'll start with a brief staff report in a few questions now.\nSpeaker 2: Diana Chang, our manager of Government Affairs. I can talk a little bit about this item.\nSpeaker 3: Vice Mayor, Council and mayor. We are aware that there are concerns that the City of Paramount and accused have around their metal.\nSpeaker 5: Facilities without.\nSpeaker 3: Getting into too much detail on on.\nSpeaker 5: The findings that a Camden Paramount have been.\nSpeaker 3: Discovering. We are willing and interested in working with the Air Quality Management District and our neighbors on figuring out any impacts to Northampton and the city of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And I just have a few questions, Miss Mustang two, and I would hope that the responses could be included in whatever report comes back. I'd like to better understand what hexavalent hexavalent chromium is. I'd like to know the difference between a regular metal shop and the ones that have hexavalent chromium emissions. I know that we have Weber Metals here in Long Beach and Paramount and a number of metal shops that are not necessarily hexavalent chromium emission emitters.

We're looking forward to creating local jobs and working with skilled craftsmen needed for these types of projects. So thank you for your consideration consideration of this resolution.

You guys want to turn around and, you know, destroy records from internal affairs or whatever, documentations or whatever. How does that help the community if I'm trying to, you know, file a complaint or issue with internal affairs about an incident and you guys are destroying records or any type of proof of the complaint that I'm trying to file or whatever. I don't really understand. How is that helping the community if there are problems, you know, are different things are coming up and these are the only records that I'm able to go by. If these, you know, items are being destroyed by the Internal Affairs Division, how would I go back and be able to, you know, target them or say that they're doing something wrong when the items would no longer be there? I requested a lot of of, you know, paperwork and documents from being harassed by, you know, police officers, different things of that nature, different organizations, paperwork that, you know, I'm filing, you know, with, regardless if it's the multipurpose center, Section eight, whatever housing paperwork that's supposed to be available to me every time we question is paperwork or whatever is either is not showing up in your eye systems or has no documentation of it. So I'm being erased. Every trail I go through, just be heard. The question is, find out why things are taking so long. All the documentation is constantly being erased and I don't know what to do, how to stop it, how to get the information before it is deleted. But it's like a cover up of anything and everything that a person is doing. They do not want to be acknowledged, are aware of, and I feel like I'm not being protected by you guys and I don't have money to go out and pay for a lawyer or, you know, someone that knows the trail to get to these documents before they're destroyed. And it doesn't say which departments are destroying them at what time or what dates or nothing else. So I don't know if evidence is going to be lost forever by me not coming here, because this is only the only trail that actually shows that I had been here going requested help.

My name is Robert Brink and I'm here on behalf of Advanced Microgrid Solutions. We're here to support Resolution 18 340. We're very excited for this advanced energy storage system. This project will provide significant cost savings to the city, improve local grid reliability and reduce carbon emissions, as we already heard tonight from me and others. Long Beach is has been and is a leader and innovator in more efficient use of its energy resources, promoting sustainability and reducing emissions. I think that ethos has been reflected in our discussions with the impressive team at Public Works, an equal amount of work, professionalism and diligence they put into evaluating this opportunity. And as mentioned, I'd also like to thank IBEW Local 11 for taking their time tonight to support this project. We're looking forward to creating local jobs and working with skilled craftsmen needed for these types of projects. So thank you for your consideration consideration of this resolution. We look forward to working with Long Beach to create a cleaner, more resilient and more efficient electric grid for the local community. Thank you. Okay, thank you. There's a motion and a second. Please come forward. Are you on the consent calendar.\\nSpeaker 3: Please? Kitchen counter. My name is Victoria Marshall. I have a couple of comments to this. Say you guys.\\nSpeaker 1: Are.\\nSpeaker 3: Saying that you guys win. Which one was it? The legislation and the state issues. You guys want to turn around and, you know, destroy records from internal affairs or whatever, documentations or whatever. How does that help the community if I'm trying to, you know, file a complaint or issue with internal affairs about an incident and you guys are destroying records or any type of proof of the complaint that I'm trying to file or whatever. I don't really understand. How is that helping the community if there are problems, you know, are different things are coming up and these are the only records that I'm able to go by. If these, you know, items are being destroyed by the Internal Affairs Division, how would I go back and be able to, you know, target them or say that they're doing something wrong when the items would no longer be there? I requested a lot of of, you know, paperwork and documents from being harassed by, you know, police officers, different things of that nature, different organizations, paperwork that, you know, I'm filing, you know, with, regardless if it's the multipurpose center, Section eight, whatever housing paperwork that's supposed to be available to me every time we question is paperwork or whatever is either is not showing up in your eye systems or has no documentation of it. So I'm being erased. Every trail I go through, just be heard. The question is, find out why things are taking so long. All the documentation is constantly being erased and I don't know what to do, how to stop it, how to get the information before it is deleted. But it's like a cover up of anything and everything that a person is doing. They do not want to be acknowledged, are aware of, and I feel like I'm not being protected by you guys and I don't have money to go out and pay for a lawyer or, you know, someone that knows the trail to get to these documents before they're destroyed. And it doesn't say which departments are destroying them at what time or what dates or nothing else. So I don't know if evidence is going to be lost forever by me not coming here, because this is only the only trail that actually shows that I had been here going requested help. Don't ask what's going on and everything else. But when I go in I try to get documentation of this is like it doesn't exist. Thank you.\\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, ma'am. There is a motion any second on the agenda here to pass the consent calendar minus item 14. So please cast your votes on that.\\nSpeaker 0: Motion carries.\""

It has taken a long time for us to get to a place where we know and understand our fees in a meaningful way. I know it took many years. I do want to ask specifics on an animal control licensing fee for about four years now. We've been asking that all of the licenses get coordinated through a process where you would be able to pay a partial year to catch up so that all your animals can be renewed at once, saving the department hundreds of dollars a year, if not definitely be thousands by now considering postage rates. Instead of mailing my house three animal dog license renewals at three different months of the year. You'd save a dollar by putting them all together. This has been three years in the making and I've heard excuses of, Well, we don't have a fee that works for that or we can't prorate. Do we have any progress towards that? Do we need to add a fee to the schedule or do we need to make any annotation at this time that we'd like to be able to prorate and ensure that entering into the fiscal year of 2020. Three. No. Yes. 2023. That that would be policy.\nSpeaker 8: Yeah. We have our director.\nSpeaker 2: Of Parks, Recreation and Marine.\nSpeaker 8: Who can come up and talk on that. Parks, Recreation and Marine was part of the round one fee study for our citywide fee study. So that may have also been something that was looked at during that.\nSpeaker 7: And I apologize.

If there's some other challenge that we need to tell you about, we will do that.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you. I appreciate it.

And members of the City Council. City Council's approval is being requested to amend the Fy22 master fees and charges schedule. This is something that's updated citywide at least twice a year to allow departments to meet City Council's stated policy on user fees, which calls for full.\nSpeaker 2: Cost recovery whenever appropriate.\nSpeaker 8: City Council last approved an amended master fees and charges schedule on September 7th as part of the Fy22 budget adoption.

In addition to those changes related to the cost of services study, proposed fee changes also include other department fee recommendations necessary for administrative and operational purposes.\nSpeaker 2: So that concludes my report.\nSpeaker 8: And Department Representative representatives are available to answer any specific questions you may have on proposed changes.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.

Councilman Mongo.\nSpeaker 7: I just want to take a moment to recognize the staff at financial management. It has taken a long time for us to get to a place where we know and understand our fees in a meaningful way. I know it took many years. I do want to ask specifics on an animal control licensing fee for about four years now. We've been asking that all of the licenses get coordinated through a process where you would be able to pay a partial year to catch up so that all your animals can be renewed at once, saving the department hundreds of dollars a year, if not definitely be thousands by now considering postage rates. Instead of mailing my house three animal dog license renewals at three different months of the year. You'd save a dollar by putting them all together. This has been three years in the making and I've heard excuses of, Well, we don't have a fee that works for that or we can't prorate. Do we have any progress towards that? Do we need to add a fee to the schedule or do we need to make any annotation at this time that we'd like to be able to prorate and ensure that entering into the fiscal year of 2020. Three. No. Yes. 2023. That that would be policy.\nSpeaker 8: Yeah. We have our director.\nSpeaker 2: Of Parks, Recreation and Marine.\nSpeaker 8: Who can come up and talk on that. Parks, Recreation and Marine was part of the round one fee study for our citywide fee study. So that may have also been something that was looked at during that.\nSpeaker 7: And I apologize. I know that this started before our current Parks and Rec director. We appreciate you. And we know you picked up a lot of projects and this is a big priority and I'll make sure it's done before the next fiscal year.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Thank you, Councilman Mongo. I know Stacy Danes, who unfortunately is ill tonight, or she'd be able to probably answer this more specifically. But I know in our recent council briefing last month, we did discuss this in depth. And I know she is looking into that alignment, which makes a lot of sense. So we are working towards that. And I appreciate your bringing attention to this financial matter.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you. Mr. Monaco, do I have your assurances that this is something we can pursue before the next budget cycle? Or do I need to bring an agenda item?\nSpeaker 1: Sure, we'll work on it. I'll get this as an item you and I've talked about, and we're talking with the Parks and Rec director about what's the path forward and if you'll need to bring an item. If there's some other challenge that we need to tell you about, we will do that.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you. I appreciate it. I know it's a priority for animal lovers across the city and an opportunity for us to really find some cost savings and save the money for the department.

This is this is an item that came before public safety. And we requested a report actually a very long time ago on our current fire impact fees and how those fees are utilized and how much money is a revenue is collected through those fees. In light of the recommendations or the presentation that was made by the fire department, it became apparent to all of us that we need to reassess our fire impact fees and look at alternative methods of funding fire facilities moving forward. Because we don't have really a long term way of preparing for infrastructure needs and building new facilities within the fire department. And as we start to see more density and growth throughout the city, we should be reevaluating whether our fire impact fees, our development fees that include impacts to city infrastructure are appropriate in light of our need . So this item is asking the city manager to evaluate its different financing or funding options, including creative approaches to create revenue creation for fire facilities and a report back to council with options.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman Price. Do every fiber come into the center?\nSpeaker 4: Yes, we have the issue. Your time starts now.\nSpeaker 0: Hello again. I'd like to. I'd like you all to strongly consider this item very carefully, very important. There are a lot of funding options from the case study. Clearly, our. Fire and destruction needs to be modernized and updated to reflect the needs of the city. Getting new locations is good. Getting back to planning for how to most effectively meet our needs. The construction and furnishing of new buildings defined by the services. I mean, that's a tremendous opportunity not just to work with storage, but I mean, you know, just a community resource. I mean, there's so many things that can be done when people have to defund the police. I mean, $10 million a week, $10 million for some of these properties. I mean, item to get, you know, the purchase of the property which which is a good thing to land is the most important after the city. But how we optimize and utilize that, how we prepare for emergency services and potentiality, that is very, very important. I very much appreciate the councilwoman for bringing forth. Thank you. Any room comfortable in my purse, would you? Actually.\nSpeaker 1: I guess I'll second this motion. There's not already a second.\nSpeaker 0: And also we only have a second.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I support this item, and I wanted to speak to it just because in the downtown, obviously we've had a lot of development with the downtown plan. There's other strategies that will happen after I leave office around more development throughout the city. And we also have our inclusionary housing policy that we've just adopted, recognizing that whenever we have increased density, which means new development, that we also need to respectfully ensure that we're collecting enough fees to build our infrastructure. And so I fully support this. I don't have the agenda item in front of me right now, but I'd love to see what our impact fees are and what other cities are doing. Thank you for bringing this item. It's been talked about for a while, so appreciate it, Mr. Vice Mayor. Can I just jump in real quick on this one?\nSpeaker 0: Yes, go ahead.\nSpeaker 1: I just wanted to point out that all the back up materials for this item are actually on the agenda for tonight, including the presentation that was made.

Item 19.\nSpeaker 2: Communication from Councilwoman Pryce, Chair, Public Safety Committee Recommendation or request staff to explore revisiting the fire facility's impact fee ordinance and evaluate other financing solutions that are available.\nSpeaker 0: Councilwoman Price.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. This is this is an item that came before public safety. And we requested a report actually a very long time ago on our current fire impact fees and how those fees are utilized and how much money is a revenue is collected through those fees. In light of the recommendations or the presentation that was made by the fire department, it became apparent to all of us that we need to reassess our fire impact fees and look at alternative methods of funding fire facilities moving forward. Because we don't have really a long term way of preparing for infrastructure needs and building new facilities within the fire department. And as we start to see more density and growth throughout the city, we should be reevaluating whether our fire impact fees, our development fees that include impacts to city infrastructure are appropriate in light of our need . So this item is asking the city manager to evaluate its different financing or funding options, including creative approaches to create revenue creation for fire facilities and a report back to council with options.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman Price. Do every fiber come into the center?\nSpeaker 4: Yes, we have the issue. Your time starts now.\nSpeaker 0: Hello again. I'd like to. I'd like you all to strongly consider this item very carefully, very important. There are a lot of funding options from the case study. Clearly, our. Fire and destruction needs to be modernized and updated to reflect the needs of the city. Getting new locations is good. Getting back to planning for how to most effectively meet our needs. The construction and furnishing of new buildings defined by the services. I mean, that's a tremendous opportunity not just to work with storage, but I mean, you know, just a community resource. I mean, there's so many things that can be done when people have to defund the police. I mean, $10 million a week, $10 million for some of these properties. I mean, item to get, you know, the purchase of the property which which is a good thing to land is the most important after the city. But how we optimize and utilize that, how we prepare for emergency services and potentiality, that is very, very important. I very much appreciate the councilwoman for bringing forth. Thank you. Any room comfortable in my purse, would you? Actually.\nSpeaker 1: I guess I'll second this motion. There's not already a second.\nSpeaker 0: And also we only have a second.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I support this item, and I wanted to speak to it just because in the downtown, obviously we've had a lot of development with the downtown plan. There's other strategies that will happen after I leave office around more development throughout the city. And we also have our inclusionary housing policy that we've just adopted, recognizing that whenever we have increased density, which means new development, that we also need to respectfully ensure that we're collecting enough fees to build our infrastructure. And so I fully support this. I don't have the agenda item in front of me right now, but I'd love to see what our impact fees are and what other cities are doing. Thank you for bringing this item. It's been talked about for a while, so appreciate it, Mr. Vice Mayor. Can I just jump in real quick on this one?\nSpeaker 0: Yes, go ahead.\nSpeaker 1: I just wanted to point out that all the back up materials for this item are actually on the agenda for tonight, including the presentation that was made.

I'm one of the partners and owner of the Good Barn Eatery. This is my business partner, and he's also a business owner of the Good Barn Eatery with his mom. That's right up there. She's one of our business partners and his wife. We are Long Beach residents, born and raised, went to school here, went to college here. Now we have some small families here. We have multiple businesses here. Him and his wife also on a very successful salon, but I'm not sure. My wife and I are on a speech pathology clinic up in Bixby because we have one in Garden Grove as well. I own a real estate investment holding company and we just love 100. So we spend all the time, all our money in Long Beach. We're just super grateful to have the opportunity to have this like wonderful places. But since early sixties, you know, just kind of continue. It wasn't the nicest place in the neighborhood for a long time. We busted our butts and got it really cleaned up and made it really nice. We actually went out and got some really nice chefs from Long Beach to kind of come in and do all of our consulting for our menu. And all of the neighbors are thrilled because they wouldn't go in there before it, and now they're in there maybe once or twice a week. So it's been really nice.\\nSpeaker 3: Does he do anything.\\nSpeaker 6: That, you know, they had an entertainment.\\nSpeaker 3: License there since the beginning, and we're just trying to continue on. Unfortunately, entertainment licenses are not grandfathered in and it's a new license every time we've had it for just a little over a year. And we're looking forward to providing a place for music and entertainment for Long Beach, which I think Long Beach really needs more places like that. And right now, is it a good bar? Okay. Councilmember Pierce.\\nSpeaker 0: Yes.\\nSpeaker 1: I thank you guys for coming tonight. I used to live across the street from the bull bar. Yes. So I did dare to go in. Right. And I have been in your establishment several times. The Seventh Street Collaborative actually holds their meetings there. And you guys have done a fantastic job with programing, with food, with everything. And so I wholeheartedly support this and look forward to seeing you guys continue your success.\\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you.\\nSpeaker 7: Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzalez.\\nSpeaker 0: Collect to see.\\nSpeaker 4: People from Long Beach, you know, investing and continuing to invest. So I'm sure you'll do great.\\nSpeaker 1: And great success to.\\nSpeaker 4: You. Congratulations.\\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Thank you.

But I suggest we are dealing with a third initiative here, and that is the racial equity and reconciliation report, that report on race in Long Beach. That third thing urges you to address both the other two planned, namely to advance environmental and racial justice by supporting the Climate Action Plan and to explore renewable energy resources. These two environmental plans are nested in that third report on race. We just cannot deal with either of the climate related two without looking through the racial lens of the third, because those three plans have one goal a healthy and happy life for all of us who live and work in Long Beach. Our neighbors are hurting. They are getting sick and dying. And we look to your leadership and compassion to put this right. Thank you. I yield my time.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.

Good afternoon. Good evening, Mayor, vice mayor and council members. My name is widely known and I'm a government relations manager with Southern California Edison. In light of the fact that this is going to be pushed off, I will hold off on my comment. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 5: Our next speaker is Kobe Sky.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Given that this item is being moved, I will provide additional comments when it's brought back. But I do hope that the Council recognizes the connection between the Climate Action Plan and the serious climate impacts that we're already facing as a region, and the need to have more flexibility and really control over our own future direction by considering it in, because it really is a critical step in our climate goals, in our environmental goals. Thank you.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you. Our next speaker is Stella. Ursula.\nSpeaker 2: Hello. I will hold off on my comments until the item.\nSpeaker 3: Is brought back to a an.\nSpeaker 2: Upcoming meeting. Thank you.\nSpeaker 5: Our next speaker is Maryanne Buchanan.\nSpeaker 2: I see the council and a mayor. So I am going to talk about this because I'll talk about it when it comes up later, too. But we're talking about two environmental things on this item, a climate action plan. And second, whether we should enter into a community choice energy program. But I suggest we are dealing with a third initiative here, and that is the racial equity and reconciliation report, that report on race in Long Beach. That third thing urges you to address both the other two planned, namely to advance environmental and racial justice by supporting the Climate Action Plan and to explore renewable energy resources. These two environmental plans are nested in that third report on race. We just cannot deal with either of the climate related two without looking through the racial lens of the third, because those three plans have one goal a healthy and happy life for all of us who live and work in Long Beach. Our neighbors are hurting. They are getting sick and dying. And we look to your leadership and compassion to put this right. Thank you. I yield my time.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.

Without doing that, you are raising your cost at least six times that of the. Council convened in March of 2019 for a two day workshop where they essentially spoke about. How are these climate related events separate from just the racial equity aspect, which we are all giving a considerable amount of time to.\nSpeaker 2: Create risk to the US energy.\nSpeaker 3: Infrastructure, financial markets and national security. We don't have really a full scope on how to manage and mitigate the future catastrophes that I mean, if we look, we've already kind of taken some damage and lost a part of our peer a number of years ago during a storm.

Recommendation to adopt resolution expressing its intent to prioritize spending of marijuana business license tax revenue for specific purposes.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilman Price.\nSpeaker 5: Yes, I'd like any money that that is generated as a result of the tax to go to the items and areas specified by the city attorney in the resolution with a special focus on public health and safety. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Great. Thank you. And I'll just add my comments here. In August, we submitted this this resolution indicating our intent to use the business license, tax revenue for public safety, public health, homelessness, and general services for regulation and enforcement. And it's great to see that in the final resolution, all of these will be prioritized for spending if this tax passes. So I do want to thank city staff and the City Council for collaboration on this resolution to ensure that the revenue is spent in a way that fully benefits our city and our residents and recovers any costs associated with the regulation of the medical marijuana ordinance should it pass by the voters. So, Councilmember Pearce.\nSpeaker 4: Yes. I also want to thank staff for their report that they did previously and just want to reiterate that do want to see the funds go to cost recovery, prioritize that and then additionally making sure that we are addressing things like first responder times both with our police and our fire, that we are using these dollars to bring back our public safety. And then you know that. When we have that in the general fund, I would definitely support any additional funding after cost recovery and public safety. Again, going to issues of health equity and and areas like that that can be addressed through services. So thank you for your work on this.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilman Andrews.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Vice Mayor. You know, I'd like to thank Mr. Parkins for drafting this resolution. And I would hope that when we talk about public safety, we're not only talking about police and enforcement, but the critical fire service as well. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Is there any public comment on this item?\nSpeaker 6: Mm hmm.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening, my Mayor Richardson and honorable city council members. My name is Margaret Dudley and I live in the ninth District. And I would just like to speak on the. The priority for the. The measure a spending funding. I believe you're going to need that for first responders. Police first. Hospitals, mental health care. Also paramedics. You're going to need it also for attorney lawyers because it's going to be a lot of lawsuits. So you need to prioritize that money that you're going to get from Missouri for that. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Margaret. Next.\nSpeaker 7: Night seven works in Soho district is for two resident. Speaking on this agenda item for two different reasons. One, as I stated before, the current tax rates that are being considered under measure M-A are cost prohibitive for a business that is that is currently built for businesses that are going to be taxed under federal schedule to 80 , an effective rate of anywhere between 50 and 80%. So for the purpose of controlling the black market, the best way to meet and to ensure that that will happen is to give support to the businesses that are putting putting themselves in front of the breach and accepting the registration and working within written to the the created regulatory scheme. As such, it would be, you know, even a business like a business tax that anywhere from 8 to 12% is really cost prohibitive for, especially in the retail sector. Secondly, in the interest of protecting measure, it may and the ability in the city's ability to tax at this particular at at these levels, it's I think the city's being too cute by half by engaging in what is by all means a special tax. Any proposition to analysis that goes into the legislative intent of this measure, especially the ones that are being expressed at this turning time, especially for specific allocations towards public towards public safety and cost allocation, as we're talking about, really indicates something that is a special tax and that's fantastic. If the city wants to raise money for first responders, mental health, public health, I'll go along with them. But you also are going to be subject to it to the to it towards passing that particular measure at a two thirds rate, not a 50% plus one. Simple as that. Thank you.

Recommendation to adopt resolution expressing its intent to prioritize spending of marijuana business license tax revenue for specific purposes.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilman Price.\nSpeaker 5: Yes, I'd like any money that that is generated as a result of the tax to go to the items and areas specified by the city attorney in the resolution with a special focus on public health and safety. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Great. Thank you. And I'll just add my comments here. In August, we submitted this this resolution indicating our intent to use the business license, tax revenue for public safety, public health, homelessness, and general services for regulation and enforcement. And it's great to see that in the final resolution, all of these will be prioritized for spending if this tax passes. So I do want to thank city staff and the City Council for collaboration on this resolution to ensure that the revenue is spent in a way that fully benefits our city and our residents and recovers any costs associated with the regulation of the medical marijuana ordinance should it pass by the voters. So, Councilmember Pearce.\nSpeaker 4: Yes. I also want to thank staff for their report that they did previously and just want to reiterate that do want to see the funds go to cost recovery, prioritize that and then additionally making sure that we are addressing things like first responder times both with our police and our fire, that we are using these dollars to bring back our public safety. And then you know that. When we have that in the general fund, I would definitely support any additional funding after cost recovery and public safety. Again, going to issues of health equity and and areas like that that can be addressed through services. So thank you for your work on this.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilman Andrews.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Vice Mayor. You know, I'd like to thank Mr. Parkins for drafting this resolution. And I would hope that when we talk about public safety, we're not only talking about police and enforcement, but the critical fire service as well. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Is there any public comment on this item?\nSpeaker 6: Mm hmm.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening, my Mayor Richardson and honorable city council members. My name is Margaret Dudley and I live in the ninth District. And I would just like to speak on the. The priority for the. The measure a spending funding. I believe you're going to need that for first responders. Police first. Hospitals, mental health care. Also paramedics. You're going to need it also for attorney lawyers because it's going to be a lot of lawsuits. So you need to prioritize that money that you're going to get from Missouri for that. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Margaret. Next.\nSpeaker 7: Night seven works in Soho district is for two resident. Speaking on this agenda item for two different reasons. One, as I stated before, the current tax rates that are being considered under measure M-A are cost prohibitive for a business that is that is currently built for businesses that are going to be taxed under federal schedule to 80 , an effective rate of anywhere between 50 and 80%. So for the purpose of controlling the black market, the best way to meet and to ensure that that will happen is to give support to the businesses that are putting putting themselves in front of the breach and accepting the registration and working within written to the the created regulatory scheme. As such, it would be, you know, even a business like a business tax that anywhere from 8 to 12% is really cost prohibitive for, especially in the retail sector. Secondly, in the interest of protecting measure, it may and the ability in the city's ability to tax at this particular at at these levels, it's I think the city's being too cute by half by engaging in what is by all means a special tax. Any proposition to analysis that goes into the legislative intent of this measure, especially the ones that are being expressed at this turning time, especially for specific allocations towards public towards public safety and cost allocation, as we're talking about, really indicates something that is a special tax and that's fantastic. If the city wants to raise money for first responders, mental health, public health, I'll go along with them. But you also are going to be subject to it to the to it towards passing that particular measure at a two thirds rate, not a 50% plus one. Simple as that. Thank you. And have a good day.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Take it back behind the rail. Let's go ahead. And members, please cast your vote.\nSpeaker 1: Motion carries.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.

What do you have to say? Vocally, I say okay. Reconsider is not debatable. Right? I'm sorry. The question I have to reconsider. There's a potential conflict of interest. We have to vote on the reconsideration before we take the item, correct? That's correct. Okay. So any discussion on the reconsideration saying nonmembers members raise your hand if you're okay with reconsideration of item number 11. Okay. Madam Clerk, it looks like that approved.

You while I support this item. I think it's good to keep in mind. And it's a reminder, though, notwithstanding the good effort the police department have, the ranks, the numbers of the police are down at a all time low. And it's going to be, what, 3 to 4 years before we're back up there. And it what sharpens. This is what happened on the blue line two days ago. Which was I? One of probably the worst experiences I've seen when the train left. PCH for Willow took about six and a half minutes and there was a very violent in terms of conduct and language mail attacking verbally and walking back and forth and threatening or using language, in your words. That has never crossed my lips or anybody I know of. And that continued on. And it's a matter of record. I've called the MTA, wrote rid of written a letter. It call also the police. Right then there was no police on the station at PCH, none at Pacific Coast Highway, none in Willow. When the train pulled into Willow, I walked up to knocked. I left one part of the car, walked up to the front, took the bike, walked up, knock on the door. The driver asked him to call the police and his response was and he had heard that and he said, well, he hasn't hurt her yet has he . So forth. And I suggest I told him to call the police.

I think it was a dollar. And that's easy to remember because that was the weekend of when Obama was in Cartagena and even the the ladies down there were holding out for their price. They didn't give up like this city council. One says.\\nSpeaker 7: Sir, sir, you cannot sir, you cannot speak out during the council meeting I Well then you have to leave and go outside. It doesn't matter. You cannot sing or speak during the council meeting. Mr.. Good. To continue.\\nSpeaker 8: To do.\\nSpeaker 0: My apology. You know, it's not it's no wonder it's no wonder the that company came to Long Beach. And got the contract for, what is it, near $10 million to build a parking lot? If he knew right where the garbage was. Right where the garbage was, right here. And then what if we find they had an extensive record of fraud, embezzlement, crime? They felt a long basis for police to come so forth. Thank you.\\nSpeaker 7: There's a motion in a second, Councilmember Pearce.\\nSpeaker 3: Yes, I did want to just take a little the opportunity that I didn't take previously to say when I met with Raintree, I just really was excited about thinking outside of the box and going above and beyond what's required in a project like this. And so looking at the alleyways, talking about doing the mural, the walkability there, connecting the promenade to areas that we typically don't think to connect to, including the arts, and also thinking creatively about our parking challenges that we have. So I just wanted to publicly say I really appreciate the partnership that we've already started. So thank you.\\nSpeaker 7: Thank you. Please cast your vote.\\nSpeaker 6: Motion carries.\\nSpeaker 7: Okay. Thank you. Thanks again. And we're going to go ahead, go back to the regular agenda item 29.\""

The committee recommends the bill pass.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Madam Clerk. Councilmember Lewis, it's all you.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you so much, Madam President. Hopefully, this can be a comparatively brief agenda item. Council Bill 120264 is aptly described by the title of the legislation. We heard a great presentation in committee last week from the Parks Department on the need to have a clearer regime to define what commercial activity might be in a park, and to have some kind of system to regulate the extent to which there can be allowed commercial activity, both in terms of the time and the space that that takes up in a public park going forward. So for the first time, this legislation creates a definition of what is considered commercial activity. To give a couple of examples of the kinds of activity parks has in mind that they would like to be able to facilitate with some level of consideration. And to do only permit would be something like an exercise class or a yoga class or some kind of mild food concession that might be seasonal. So some examples that were given were the food truck pilot for permitting in Westlake Park, which has been a fairly common occurrence over the last couple of years in the downtown core and potentially having services similar to that on a seasonal basis and some other parks around the city. This legislation was passed unanimously out of committee with five councilmembers voting in favor and nine opposed. And I am happy to move the legislation.\nSpeaker 0: Is there a second, second rate? Are there any other comments regarding Councilmember Lewis's legislation? Not seeing or hearing none. Will the clerk please call the role on the passage of the bill?\nSpeaker 2: Want? Yes. Strauss. Yes.\nSpeaker 5: LEWIS Yes.\nSpeaker 2: Morales Yes. MACHEDA All right. Nelson, I. Peterson.\nSpeaker 5: I.\nSpeaker 2: Council President Juarez. I Ididn't favor none of those.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Before we move on to a chairman and other businesses, I have a few comments I want to make that I had been hoping that I would not have to make at this point, but apparently it looks like I. Moving forward as a point of order, this council president will have an exercise and hopefully you will all recognize my quote unquote, my virtual gavel that it will mute us. I am going to rely on our colleagues to abide by all rules, hold us accountable to rules, behavior, and courtesy of decorum, civility and basic kindness. The members are reminded that it is never in order to make personal remarks or attacks. The members are reminded that colleagues will not attack or question the integrity or motives of other colleagues. And the members are reminded that we will not be discourteous to each other or make personal and insulting remarks. I'm hoping that going forward as council president, that we instill a safe place, a kind place, so the rest of the city can see that we are a functioning council. They can agree to, agree to disagree and still move forward for this great city. Again, I will use the point of order and I will mute us if indeed this Council President feels that we are not following those basic rules of decency and debate to our colleagues. So with that colleagues, this concludes our items of business today. Our next regularly scheduled city council meeting is on February 15th two, and I hope you all have a great afternoon. Thank you, Madam President. Yes.\nSpeaker 5: Sorry. I did have a good of the order item. I apologize. But just briefly, I would like to ask to be excused from the March 20 seconds and 29 Council meetings.\nSpeaker 0: Tuesday to Thursday Senate March due to Tuesdays to Tuesdays. Okay. Well, let's do this then. Well, I do not have my script here, so I'm just going to have to do it from memory. It seems that Council member Lewis would like to be excused. Are there any is there any opposition or concerns or comments that you would like to share with Mr. Lewis on why he cannot be excused on those two Tuesdays? Hearing or seeing none. You were indeed excused. Mr. Lewis.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you, Madam President. Sorry for just jumping in there.\nSpeaker 0: That's right. It's. That's how I like it. Just jump right on in. Let me know. I have no problem being told when I'm wrong. Thank you.",

    "source": "Speaker 5: The report of the Energy Environment Committee and item ten Constable 1189 12 relating to the satellite department and the Department of Parks Recreation superseding Section seven of Ordinance 124 917 and transferring jurisdiction of the former Dulwich substation from the City Light Department to the Department of Parks and Recreation for Open Space Park Immigration Purposes Committee recommends the bill pass.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Council members. So on.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Britain Brian. This council constable transfers of former substation property in the deluge neighborhood of Seattle from City Light to the Parks Department. Under state law, public utilities are financially distinct from the city, and so the property had to be sold at fair market value. In this case, the property was not part of Park's strategic plan, but the community wanted to maintain it as a greenspace. So the Delbridge Neighborhoods Development Association raised the money by winning grants to pay for it, and that menu is attached to the Council bill. I want to thank Dale Rich Neighborhoods Development Association for their work on behalf of their community and also thanks to City Light staff who as usual, have made sure to give the community the time they need to make the whole thing work. They went through a transparent process. My office also visited the property with the community members back in 2014, which is also a reflection of the careful way that City Light staff approached the disposition of property of this kind. And the committee recommends for council pass the bill.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Council members want any further comments? Councilmember Herbold.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. I just want to say a few words. This project is in my district, District one. No, this is a project that our committee members have been working on for quite some time. I actually was on a community tour last week when this was being heard in committee. I want to thank the Parks Department for their funding contribution as well as King County for for theirs as well. The work that community members and our neighborhood district associations specifically I want to call out Willie Brown is fantastic in the vision for this property is really exciting as well. Not only will they be using the space for a natural wetland which will detail storm water runoff, alleviating flooding of neighborhood yards and driveways, but it will also provide a bio filtration of stormwater runoff before it enters Longfellow Creek. And then DDA will partner with Seattle Tilth and Nature Consortium and staff and students from Louisa Boren stem k through eight school to develop and manage the remaining part of the property as a permanent culture food forest. And this is really important for this community because Delbridge is a food desert. The land management system contains aspects of the native habitat with edible forest gardening and a children's garden will link classroom and field experience to educate local youth in environmental science and stewardship and atmosphere. So this is just a fantastic project. It's been a long time coming and thanks to Councilmember Swann as well for shepherding this legislation through her committee.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you for those comments. Councilmember Horrible. Any further comments? Please call the role on the passage of the bill.\nSpeaker 5: Marez O'Brien.\nSpeaker 0: All right.\nSpeaker 4: So I beg Sean Burgess.\nSpeaker 5: Gonzalez Purple. Johnson President Harrell. All right. Nine in favor and unopposed.\nSpeaker 3: Bill passed and Cheryl signed it.

        "\"Speaker 5: The report of the Energy Environment Committee and item ten Constable 1189 12 relating to the satellite department and the Department of Parks Recreation superseding Section seven of Ordinance 124 917 and transferring jurisdiction of the former Dulwich substation from the City Light Department to the Department of Parks and Recreation for Open Space Park Immigration Purposes Committee recommends the bill pass.\\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Council members. So on.\\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Britain Brian. This council constable transfers of former substation property in the deluge neighborhood of Seattle from City Light to the Parks Department. Under state law, public utilities are financially distinct from the city, and so the property had to be sold at fair market value. In this case, the property was not part of Park's strategic plan, but the community wanted to maintain it as a greenspace. So the Delbridge Neighborhoods Development Association raised the money by winning grants to pay for it, and that menu is attached to the Council bill. I want to thank Dale Rich Neighborhoods Development Association for their work on behalf of their community and also thanks to City Light staff who as usual, have made sure to give the community the time they need to make the whole thing work. They went through a transparent process. My office also visited the property with the community members back in 2014, which is also a reflection of the careful way that City Light staff approached the disposition of property of this kind. And the committee recommends for council pass the bill.\\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Council members want any further comments? Councilmember Herbold.\\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. I just want to say a few words. This project is in my district, District one. No, this is a project that our committee members have been working on for quite some time. I actually was on a community tour last week when this was being heard in committee. I want to thank the Parks Department for their funding contribution as well as King County for for theirs as well. The work that community members and our neighborhood district associations specifically I want to call out Willie Brown is fantastic in the vision for this property is really exciting as well. Not only will they be using the space for a natural wetland which will detail storm water runoff, alleviating flooding of neighborhood yards and driveways, but it will also provide a bio filtration of stormwater runoff before it enters Longfellow Creek. And then DDA will partner with Seattle Tilth and Nature Consortium and staff and students from Louisa Boren stem k through eight school to develop and manage the remaining part of the property as a permanent culture food forest. And this is really important for this community because Delbridge is a food desert. The land management system contains aspects of the native habitat with edible forest gardening and a children's garden will link classroom and field experience to educate local youth in environmental science and stewardship and atmosphere. So this is just a fantastic project. It's been a long time coming and thanks to Councilmember Swann as well for shepherding this legislation through her committee.\\nSpeaker 3: Thank you for those comments. Councilmember Horrible.

We had an initial ordinance that asked for the Office of Housing to do an evaluation of the rent bidding platforms, and it also included a one year prohibition on the use of these platforms. The the prohibition was to provide our office with an an understanding of whether or not these platforms were in violation of our fair housing laws or to analyze how they may impact housing costs or inequities in our area. The Office of Housing needed additional time to complete the study, so we extended the prohibition for another year. In 2019, the Office of Housing has completed its report. It was sent to council last midyear last year and it found that it found that the city needed additional data to determine whether or not there was any impacts from rent bidding platforms on our Seattle Fair Housing Ordinance. And it recommended for specific actions. The piece of legislation in front of you updates our statute to make sure that we're repealing the prohibition and also includes provisions responsive to the Office of Housing Report. This includes a request that Office of Housing collect data to track whether or not meeting platforms are functioning for bidding purposes or other non bidding functions. And. And to determine whether or not the platforms are having an impact on equitable access to housing, it requests that the Office of Civil Rights conduct testing to determine if remedying platforms are in compliance with fair housing laws. It requests that if data shows that bidding platforms are having an impact on equitable access to housing, that the OCR and Office of Housing will provide recommendations on possible regulations to mitigate unintended consequences. And it encourages rent bidding platforms to post the Seattle Open Housing poster on their website. Colleagues, I would love to have your support on this.

We had an initial ordinance that asked for the Office of Housing to do an evaluation of the rent bidding platforms, and it also included a one year prohibition on the use of these platforms. The the prohibition was to provide our office with an an understanding of whether or not these platforms were in violation of our fair housing laws or to analyze how they may impact housing costs or inequities in our area. The Office of Housing needed additional time to complete the study, so we extended the prohibition for another year. In 2019, the Office of Housing has completed its report. It was sent to council last midyear last year and it found that it found that the city needed additional data to determine whether or not there was any impacts from rent bidding platforms on our Seattle Fair Housing Ordinance. And it recommended for specific actions. The piece of legislation in front of you updates our statute to make sure that we're repealing the prohibition and also includes provisions responsive to the Office of Housing Report. This includes a request that Office of Housing collect data to track whether or not meeting platforms are functioning for bidding purposes or other non bidding functions. And. And to determine whether or not the platforms are having an impact on equitable access to housing, it requests that the Office of Civil Rights conduct testing to determine if remedying platforms are in compliance with fair housing laws. It requests that if data shows that bidding platforms are having an impact on equitable access to housing, that the OCR and Office of Housing will provide recommendations on possible regulations to mitigate unintended consequences. And it encourages rent bidding platforms to post the Seattle Open Housing poster on their website. Colleagues, I would love to have your support on this.

As I discussed in this morning's council briefing is related to the Seattle Parking Enforcement Officers Guild's Collective Bargaining Agreement. This council bill would authorize the execution of a negotiated union contract between the city of Seattle and that bargaining unit. This is a three year contract from January 1st, 2019 through December 31st, 2021, and includes approximately 105 regularly appointed city employees in the Seattle Police Department. The financial terms of this union contract are similar to those of the State Coalition's union contracts and include a retroactive 4% annual wage increase for 2019 and a 3.6% annual wage increase for 2020. The financial and non-financial terms in this collective bargaining agreement were considered and approved by the members of the Labor Relations Policy Committee and are within those previously approved parameters. I'm happy to entertain any questions or hear any comments from any of my colleagues. Councilmember Peterson.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Council President Gonzalez, I appreciate.\nSpeaker 3: The hard work of our Labor Relations Policy Committee and the difficult decisions that you have to make.\nSpeaker 2: I do not serve on that particular committee of legislative and executive leaders who represent management and who negotiate the multitude of employment contracts.\nSpeaker 3: Impacting 12,000 city government workers.\nSpeaker 2: I carefully consider each contract on its own terms, and.\nSpeaker 3: At this moment in time, with the grim.\nSpeaker 2: Fiscal challenges our city.\nSpeaker 3: Government faces today, I'll be voting no on this particular contract for parking enforcement officers. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Peterson, for those remarks. Just really quickly, I want to be just responsive to the extent that I can. We don't need to belabor the point, but this this particular contract, and based on the evaluation given to us by the city Budget Office, does not have dire or detrimental impacts on the projected deficit of the city of Seattle. I think that I and the members of the Labor Relations Policy Committee, which include four other Council members and members of the executive team, carefully engaged with the city budget office to make sure that this was not only a high road employer contract, but also a contract that was fiscally responsible and within our existing means as a city and feel comfortable that the contract before us strikes the right balance and that in approving this contract, we will not be subjecting the city budget to to further pressure or crisis as a result of the the the contract. So I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting approval of this particular contract. Any other questions or comments, colleagues? Because remember Lewis.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much, Madam President. I do just want to signal that I will be voting in favor of ratifying this contract today. I think it's critical that as we go into what is going to be a very difficult a lot of very difficult conversations about the budget over the summer, in this fall, can we not lose sight of the fact that some of the most essential functions of government that we serve as a city are our first responders, law enforcement, firefighters, and certainly the employees that are included under this contract that provide an essential law enforcement based mechanism that is really essential to maintaining the social contract that holds the city of Seattle together . This these are some of the services that we need to fight more than ever to make sure that we are maintaining adequately and that these are workers, that we are seeking to have measures in place to retain and encourage them to stay in our workforce. There's never been a more appropriate time, I think, to ratify a contract like this for this group of workers. I hope it sets a precedent that we try to make sure that we set a budget that not only delivers essential services, but really defines our values as a progressive city. And I think it really starts by making sure that we boldly stand by some of the workers doing really essential and critical work out there. That hasn't abated during this crisis. So I will be voting in favor of this.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Lewis. Any other comments or questions on the bill? Hearing and seeing none.

Thank you.\\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Peterson, for those remarks. Just really quickly, I want to be just responsive to the extent that I can. We don't need to belabor the point, but this this particular contract, and based on the evaluation given to us by the city Budget Office, does not have dire or detrimental impacts on the projected deficit of the city of Seattle. I think that I and the members of the Labor Relations Policy Committee, which include four other Council members and members of the executive team, carefully engaged with the city budget office to make sure that this was not only a high road employer contract, but also a contract that was fiscally responsible and within our existing means as a city and feel comfortable that the contract before us strikes the right balance and that in approving this contract, we will not be subjecting the city budget to to further pressure or crisis as a result of the the the contract. So I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting approval of this particular contract. Any other questions or comments, colleagues? Because remember Lewis.\\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much, Madam President. I do just want to signal that I will be voting in favor of ratifying this contract today. I think it's critical that as we go into what is going to be a very difficult a lot of very difficult conversations about the budget over the summer, in this fall, can we not lose sight of the fact that some of the most essential functions of government that we serve as a city are our first responders, law enforcement, firefighters, and certainly the employees that are included under this contract that provide an essential law enforcement based mechanism that is really essential to maintaining the social contract that holds the city of Seattle together . This these are some of the services that we need to fight more than ever to make sure that we are maintaining adequately and that these are workers, that we are seeking to have measures in place to retain and encourage them to stay in our workforce. There's never been a more appropriate time, I think, to ratify a contract like this for this group of workers. I hope it sets a precedent that we try to make sure that we set a budget that not only delivers essential services, but really defines our values as a progressive city. And I think it really starts by making sure that we boldly stand by some of the workers doing really essential and critical work out there. That hasn't abated during this crisis. So I will be voting in favor of this.\\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Lewis. Any other comments or questions on the bill? Hearing and seeing none.

I'm glad we have the day because that was my whole comment is about why we should let people know when the hearing is. They just want to say that usually allegations are non-controversial issues. But I just wanted to draw a little attention to this one. As chair of the Energy Committee, this litigation is for the construction of the Denny substation, which is a very large Seattle City Light project in the middle of the Cascade neighborhood, the residential neighborhood and several low income housing buildings are immediately adjacent to the construction site, and substations usually don't go in such dense, densely populated areas. But this one is an exception. I do know that City Light has done a lot of outreach so far to the community and has found ways in which to mitigate the potential impact of the construction of this project on the neighbors. And I support moving forward to the public hearing. Just wanted to highlight the hearing just in case somebody is listening and wants an opportunity to comment. So thank you.\\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you very much. So to repeat again, the hearing is July 35, 30 PM at the Bell Town Community Center. Any other questions or comments? All in favor of adopting Resolution 31594 setting the public hearing vote. I oppose vote no. The resolution is unanimously adopted. Is there any other business? Councilmember Gardner, the Central Waterfront Committee will meet next. And beginning at what time?\\nSpeaker 2: May I suggest that because of the very large number of citizens here in support of the resolution on the Vietnamese Heritage and Freedom flag, please can we plan 15 minutes between full council and the waterfront committee so that council members may briefly join the community in the birthday Atlantis room if they wish. However, since we do expect an audience at the Waterfront Committee and we will not be able to start the committee until there are at least five council members. So let's be back promptly at 330.\\nSpeaker 3: All right.\\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. So we'll reconvene at 330 as the Select Committee on the Central Waterfront. The city council is now adjourned.\""

Councilmember Esqueda, you are the sponsor of this bill, so you are recognized in order to address this item, please.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Council President. This legislation adopts amendments to the 2019 Annual Action Plan to detail how the city will spend approximately 8.9 million of dollars in federal funds allocated to the city through Housing and Urban Development for COVID response, including CBD funds, ESG and housing opportunities for people with AIDS or the Heart grant. These funds were appropriated by the Council through Ordinance of 126074 and 126084 passed in May. Funds have been allocated to the Human Services Department, Office of Housing and the Office of Economic Development to prevent, prepare and respond to the coronavirus. These funds will support emergency rental assistance, grant payments to small businesses and meal programs for people experiencing homelessness. In order to enter into grant agreements with HUD and to receive the funds, we have been directed to amend our most current annual action plans for these appropriations. You will note that we approved the 2020 Annual Action Plan in May. However, since the grant agreements for the 2020 Annual Action Plan have not yet been executed by Housing and Urban Development. The 2019 Annual Action Plan is still our current plan, and therefore we must send in that plan to receive these paired COVID emergency funds. Last week we held a public hearing on the legislation on Monday. Thank you to the public because the vote on that, this legislation is considered part of the budget rebalancing package. However, it is scheduled for a vote today because adoption of amendments to the annual action plans are required before these funds can be distributed.

I just want to highlight for folks, both in our renter communities as well as to the folks who are providing rental housing to to renters, that this amended plan clearly states that the 1.4 million that the council previously moved away from rental assistance towards shelter will be spent on rental assistance.

        "\"Speaker 2: Agenda Item one Capital 119814 related to the funding for housing and community development programs, adopting a substantial amendment to the City of Seattle 2019.\\nSpeaker 0: Annual.\\nSpeaker 2: Action Plan Amendment to the 2018 to 2022 Plan for Housing and Development and operating its submission to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.\\nSpeaker 0: Thank you so much. Okay, I will move to pass Council Bill 119814. Is there a second icon? It has been moved and seconded to pass the bill. Councilmember Esqueda, you are the sponsor of this bill, so you are recognized in order to address this item, please.\\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Council President. This legislation adopts amendments to the 2019 Annual Action Plan to detail how the city will spend approximately 8.9 million of dollars in federal funds allocated to the city through Housing and Urban Development for COVID response, including CBD funds, ESG and housing opportunities for people with AIDS or the Heart grant. These funds were appropriated by the Council through Ordinance of 126074 and 126084 passed in May. Funds have been allocated to the Human Services Department, Office of Housing and the Office of Economic Development to prevent, prepare and respond to the coronavirus. These funds will support emergency rental assistance, grant payments to small businesses and meal programs for people experiencing homelessness. In order to enter into grant agreements with HUD and to receive the funds, we have been directed to amend our most current annual action plans for these appropriations. You will note that we approved the 2020 Annual Action Plan in May. However, since the grant agreements for the 2020 Annual Action Plan have not yet been executed by Housing and Urban Development. The 2019 Annual Action Plan is still our current plan, and therefore we must send in that plan to receive these paired COVID emergency funds. Last week we held a public hearing on the legislation on Monday. Thank you to the public because the vote on that, this legislation is considered part of the budget rebalancing package. However, it is scheduled for a vote today because adoption of amendments to the annual action plans are required before these funds can be distributed. Thank you, Madam President.\\nSpeaker 0: Thank you so much, Councilmember Mosqueda. Are there any additional comments or questions on the bill? Councilmember Herbold, please.\\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. I just want to highlight for folks, both in our renter communities as well as to the folks who are providing rental housing to to renters, that this amended plan clearly states that the 1.4 million that the council previously moved away from rental assistance towards shelter will be spent on rental assistance. This plan will help ensure that desperately needed resources for homelessness, prevention and rental assistance are restored. I think as we originally intended a couple weeks ago now. Thank you.\\nSpeaker 0: Thank you so much, Councilmember Herbold. Any other questions or comments on the bill? Okay. Hearing it? None. I would ask that the clerk please call the roll on the passage of the bill.\\nSpeaker 1: Herbold, i. Whereas.\\nSpeaker 2: Hi.\\nSpeaker 1: Louis.\\nSpeaker 3: Hi.\\nSpeaker 1: Morales.\\nSpeaker 0: I just gotta.\\nSpeaker 2: I.\\nSpeaker 1: Petersen. I want Strauss.\\nSpeaker 3: I.\\nSpeaker 1: President Gonzalez high nine in favor unopposed.\\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Madam Clerk. The bill passes and the chair will sign it. Will the please affix my signature to the legislation on my behalf? Okay, folks, we're going to move on to item two. Will the clerk please read agenda item two into the record?\""

Speaker Committee recommends the bill pass.\nSpeaker 1: Casper. Mesquita.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Mr. Chair. First, I want to say thank you to our friends at the ACLU. The folks at ACLU, specifically Shanker and Orion, has been working to make sure that we put into place advanced meter infrastructure technology that protects the data of all consumers. Councilmember O'Brien has been working on this for a while, and I want to thank the folks at Seattle City Light and the Office of the Attorneys, the city attorneys as well. We have been able to craft legislation that I think accomplishes the following. We want to make sure that an AI led technology is implemented in a way to make sure that we can monitor energy efficiency and improve the collection of actual data so that our bills reflect the actual usage and that we can identify ways to improve energy efficiency over the long haul. What we know is that because of Councilmember Brian and the previous council here, there has been policies put into place in rules that do protect consumer data. What this legislation does is it codifies our commitment to making sure that all data is truly protected, that we as a city and our subcontractors don't share, disclose or make available consumer data in a way that would be inappropriate. We want to make sure that every customer, every resident in Seattle feels comfortable using the AMI technology and for those who don't. This legislation also sets limits on the fees associated with opting out, making it clear that they can be no more than the cost of actually reading the alternative meter. So that I think that we create a little bit more parity here. Again, I think that this is important for us as we get into new areas where we're using technology in different ways, where we're collecting data that we haven't collected in the past. We need to step up and make sure that our contracts and our commitment to protect data reflect each other. So I'm really excited about the type of commitments this will put in place for contracts in the future. We also want to make sure that the customers feel that we have responded to their concerns with urgency, and I think that this legislation does that. So I appreciate the past steps that Seattle City has made, and I really hope that the Council will adopt this resolution or sorry, adopt this ordinance today to codify these rules into statute. Again, I want to thank Councilmember O'Brien. Thank you to your staff, especially Lakeisha Farmer, who's been working with us on this. And I look forward to working with you all to make sure that we implement these councilmember action. Councilmembers have been very helpful as well in our committee as we talked about this issue multiple times over the last few months. So thank you to all of you for your collaboration and for helping us to find the right path forward on AMI protections.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Customers get any comments?\nSpeaker 4: Councilmember Yeah. Thank you. I want to go right back at Councilmember Mosquito. I really appreciated the time you've spent on this and bringing Seattle City Light to the table. But also, I think importantly, a number of our I would consider them to be some of the loyal opposition around privacy that they wanted to make sure that we were not going in and getting data from people's homes and businesses that they felt was personal. And the fact that we had ACLU involved in the conversations and that at our last meeting, I asked one of the speakers directly. Are you supporting this legislation as is? And the answer was yes. So thank you so much for the work that you've done in pulling this together. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Q Councilmember O'Brien.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you for your comments, Councilman Muscat. I appreciate the recognition, but I want to say that to get it to this point required a lot of work, and it was just a lot of back and forth on nuances of working with attorneys in the department. And I want to give credit to the city attorney's office and Seattle, see the light for them showing up for those conversations. But I know you and your team put a lot of time into getting it here, and I'm grateful to get the chance to work with you on this. I'm really proud of this legislation and thank you for doing that.\nSpeaker 1: Very good.

We need to step up and make sure that our contracts and our commitment to protect data reflect each other. So I'm really excited about the type of commitments this will put in place for contracts in the future. We also want to make sure that the customers feel that we have responded to their concerns with urgency, and I think that this legislation does that. So I appreciate the past steps that Seattle City has made, and I really hope that the Council will adopt this resolution or sorry, adopt this ordinance today to codify these rules into statute. Again, I want to thank Councilmember O'Brien. Thank you to your staff, especially Lakeisha Farmer, who's been working with us on this. And I look forward to working with you all to make sure that we implement these councilmember action. Councilmembers have been very helpful as well in our committee as we talked about this issue multiple times over the last few months. So thank you to all of you for your collaboration and for helping us to find the right path forward on AMI protections.\\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Customers get any comments?\\nSpeaker 4: Councilmember Yeah. Thank you. I want to go right back at Councilmember Mosquito. I really appreciated the time you've spent on this and bringing Seattle City Light to the table. But also, I think importantly, a number of our I would consider them to be some of the loyal opposition around privacy that they wanted to make sure that we were not going in and getting data from people's homes and businesses that they felt was personal. And the fact that we had ACLU involved in the conversations and that at our last meeting, I asked one of the speakers directly. Are you supporting this legislation as is? And the answer was yes. So thank you so much for the work that you've done in pulling this together. Thank you.\\nSpeaker 1: Q Councilmember O'Brien.\\nSpeaker 8: Thank you for your comments, Councilman Muscat. I appreciate the recognition, but I want to say that to get it to this point required a lot of work, and it was just a lot of back and forth on nuances of working with attorneys in the department. And I want to give credit to the city attorney's office and Seattle, see the light for them showing up for those conversations. But I know you and your team put a lot of time into getting it here, and I'm grateful to get the chance to work with you on this. I'm really proud of this legislation and thank you for doing that.\\nSpeaker 1: Very good. Just like we got a couple of votes and the other was okay, please call the roll on the passage of the bill.\\nSpeaker 2: JOHNSON Macheda I. O'BRIEN Hi, Sergeant Bakeshop. Gonzales Hi, Herbold. President Harrell. Hi. Eight in favor and unopposed.\\nSpeaker 1: Bill passed and chair of the Senate.

Please read the report.\nSpeaker 1: Because the report, the full council agenda item one, resolution 316 19, providing an honorary designation of South Jackson Street from 27 south to 23rd Avenue South. S Ernestine Anderson Way.\nSpeaker 0: The council member o'brien.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. So this is coming directly to full council. This ordinance would direct to the Seattle Department of Transportation to manufacture, install and maintain honourary signs at the intersections of South Jackson Street and 20th Avenue, South South Jackson Street and 20th Place, south South Jackson Street and 22nd Avenue, South and South Jackson Street and 23rd Avenue South . Each will reflect the Ernestine Anderson Way honorary designation. Racine Anderson was a legendary American jazz and blues singer from Seattle Center Area and graduate of Garfield High School and Ernestine Anderson Place, a senior affordable housing complex, was constructed in 2012 on South Jackson Street between 20th Avenue South and 20th place south. So this designation will occur adjacent to that housing complex. I did not have an honor to hear Ernestine Anderson perform. She passed away at the age of 87 earlier this year. But her legacy certainly is impressive. One anecdote I read in her obituary talked about how she was born in Houston and moved to Seattle in high school , and her father came to Seattle looking for work, but also because he wanted to be on the West Coast. And Seattle is like a sleepy town where he could get his daughter away from the music scene. Little did he know that Garfield in the Central District at that time was just emerging, and she played a significant role in that. And her overlap with Quincy Jones and Ray Charles and other folks who were in the music scene in Seattle at that time were impressive. This is a great a great chance to honor one of the leaders in our community for so long and look forward to voting yes on this bill.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Rodney, for the comments. Alex, say a few words. No one else would. Casper and Brian, thank you for describing Ms.. Anderson's background. And many people have been around Seattle for decades and many are recent arrivals. And I just think it's critically important when we celebrate this kind of history is, as you described, she recorded over 37 albums in her lifetime and she was really celebrated as a jazz artists throughout the world when she attended Garfield High School. That's where she met Quincy Jones. And you have to talk publicly about Quincy was a classmate of my mother and father's at Garfield. High school. And so I've had the opportunity to sort of over the years, interface with Miss Anderson's family. And her daughter Yvonne was attending school with myself. She's part of some great history in Seattle with groups such as Bumps Blackwell and Buddy Catlett and, of course, Quincy Jones. And those folks, if you go to the Safeway on 23rd and in Madison, you'll see a picture of a group called Bumps Blackwell. That many folks. It was just one of the best jazz groups around. And Quincy Jones is in that picture. And my father is a saxophone player sitting right next to Quincy Jones. So it's quite extraordinary what talent has come out of this city. Quincy Jones described Ernestine his voice as, quote, honey at dusk, and he said that the world got a taste of her honey. And she performed in the Monterey Jazz Festivals at Carnegie Hall in the White House during the first inauguration of Dwight Eisenhower at the Kennedy Center. She toured Europe and had many concerts in London and New York. So again, quite a local treasure. In 1999, the Pulitzer Prize winning photographer, Brian Lenker published a book I think many of you have heard of. It's called I Dream a World. And in that book, she he describes 75 women, African-American women who really changed America, Coretta Scott King, Sarah Vaughan, Oprah Winfrey, Rosa Parks and our own Ernestine Anderson is in that book. So, so again, she's quite a legend. And I think as we preserved what's great in this city, I think part of that is actually preserving names like Reverend McKinney and Ernestine Anderson and others. So I'm very happy to support this resolution. You know the comments. Okay. So those in favor of adopting the resolution vote i, i, those opposed vote no. The ayes have it.

Item one Resolution 317634 related to the redevelopment of Katrina into a first class state of the Art, Multipurpose Entertainment and Sports Center at Seattle Center supporting the City of Seattle negotiation with Oak View Group, LLC regarding the possible redevelopment operation of the Arena at Seattle Center and requesting that the Mayor to negotiate a memorandum of understanding with OPG for the City Council's consideration and action.\nSpeaker 2: Councilmember Juarez I believe Councilmember Herbold has a substitute motion to make.\nSpeaker 5: I move to amend Resolution 31765 by substituting version two for version one B.\nSpeaker 1: Second.\nSpeaker 0: And moved in second to make a substitution and customer service. Do you want to explain what we're doing here, please?\nSpeaker 5: Yes, absolutely. So the substitute adds three new sets of language. The first is to add a recital to recognize the council's letter of June 26 and adds it as an attachment. Also, together with that, central staff included recommending a recital that actually refers to the letter. The second set of amendments actually incorporates two edits to memorialize and recognize in two separate places the work that Councilmember Suarez has spearheaded for an independent council consultant for Financial Review. The first edit adds a recital with language from the consultant funding request and the second notes Council's intent to review that council consultant work in Section two . And then the third amended language is to Section one. And it says specifically, in order for the council to potentially carry out review by the end of the year. The intent is to add context to this section regarding what the Council needs in order to have a chance to fulfill the goal of taking final action by the end of the year, as referenced in Section four.\nSpeaker 0: Very good, Councilmember. Whereas we know this is a friendly manner and amendment, I take it. Would you like to say any more just about the amendment?\nSpeaker 2: I have no comment to the amendment, but I certainly can speak to the resolution.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And just to sort of clarify the record, this is resolution 31764. I don't know if it's read correctly.\nSpeaker 5: I'm sorry, six five. My bad. Okay.\nSpeaker 0: So we're six four. So any questions? Just on the amendment piece. Okay. All those in favor of substituting version two for version one B, say I. I opposed the ayes have it. So now we have a new version in Council member. Whereas would you like to speak to that?\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. In regards to resolution 316 for this resolution, as we discussed this morning, is to memorialize the agreements and benchmarks we've already laid out in the last four meetings of this year. I want to thank Councilmember Bagshaw and Councilmember Harrell for co-sponsoring this resolution with me. This resolution expresses our commitment to review the MCU that is sent to us in any other documents or legal issues that would be would remain in the purview of the legislative branch. It would maintain authority to prove all subsequent agreements, and we will be ensuring the motion meets our expectations, especially those as laid out in the RFP . I want to thank Councilmember Herbold, Gonzales and Johnson for raising many important and substantive questions and issues. And I also want to thank Councilmember Burgess for his words regarding our duty, our fiduciary duty, and our due diligence in any documents that come from the executive regarding these type of agreements. Always want to end is that more input is always better and I remain committed to this process and working with my colleagues. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.

So this resolution supports the initiative. 1491. I'm sorry. Here. I have a lot of paperwork in front of me. And as you well know, 1491 is an initiative to the people of our state relative to, I say, urging voters to vote yes relative to a law that would suspend a person's access to firearms if there's documented evidence that an individual is threatening harm to themselves or others because of dangerous mental illness or a high risk of violent behavior. And if you look at the substance of the resolution itself, and I'm not at this point in the proceeding, I'm just describing the context. This is not my pro or con statement. I'm just describing the context of the resolution. And then I will ask for comments, either pro or con, but the University of California in 2014 I'm sorry, there are several incidents that have saddened our country that are described in the legislation itself, such as the incident in 2014, the University of California in Santa Barbara here in 2013 and Cafe Racer 2006. Jewish Federation of Seattle, the Seattle shooting. We can list the types of egregious behavior we've seen in this initiative. 1491 is modeled on the successful laws around the country and is based on a well-established Washington state system protection orders to fill the gaps in the system that allow people experiencing crisis or demonstrating violent behavior to possess and purchase firearms. So as described in the resolution, the contents are for the public safety of all people, including those who harm themselves. And at this point, I will move to pass Council Bill three. I will move to adopt Resolution 31701 and then I'll ask for comments after has been moved to adopt as their second. Okay. I'm sorry. 702i move to adopt resolution 31731702. Is there a second? Okay. Now, at this point, are there any comments regarding this resolution? So hearing then from my colleagues again, I'll just say it. Councilman Burgess, did you want to say a few words? Please do.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Council members, before you begin, I just want to make it clear as the rules that aren't known by many that the inclusion of our comments, we will hear comments from members of the public who wish to speak in opposition, and we will allow the same amount of time for those people as well as the rules require. Councilman Burgess.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you very much. This measure 1491, which we all get to vote on here in a few weeks at the November election, is another common sense measure around gun safety. The vast majority of gun violence incidents in the state of Washington and frankly, across the United States, almost three quarters of those cases involve suicide or unintentional shootings , what some people refer to as accidental shootings. And in many of those cases, members of families or close personal friends are often aware of the looming crisis that is being presented to a family. And so with the passage of this initiative in November, family members will be able to go before a court and petition for a protection order, which may include the seizure of firearms in the possession of someone who is at great risk. And I hope that my colleagues will join in supporting this measure, supporting initiative 1491, and that the people of Washington state will likewise support that initiative.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Councilman Burgess. Any further comments from any of my colleagues? I do have at least one person who may want to speak in opposition to this particular item. And Mr.. Mr.. Locke, did you wish to speak on this item, sir, at all dealing with the Firearm Initiative Measure 1491. Did you wish to speak to that? You had signed up on several lists? No. Well, let me call for any public comment. Are there any members of the public comment that would like to speak in opposition to this particular resolution or to initiative measure 1491? He? We do. Please come forward, ma'am. And, Amelia, can you make sure this is safe?\nSpeaker 4: I didn't think I was going to be talking on this issue today. But I am Cynthia Lynette, the author, the artist who has produced a body of work called The Gun Show. It will be passed around. I'm very concerned about this resolution that anybody, a family member can take somebody to court. And I don't care about taking away their guns, but then they're going to be required to go through some kind of psychiatric help. And you know what that means?\nSpeaker 5: That means psychotropic drugs. And we do not want them anymore.\nSpeaker 4: So if you could put something in here that says we are not going to give these people psychotropic drugs or require them to take it, then I might consider this. Otherwise, it is not good.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you for your words. Do any of my colleagues wish to provide any further comments on this resolution? Okay. Hearing then those in favor of adopting the resolution vote i. I. Those opposed vote no. The motion carries. The resolution stopped and chair will sign it.

Councilmember Mosquito.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to move to be excused beginning next Monday, October 14th through January 27th of 2020 for parental leave. This includes 12 weeks of parental leave and the two weeks of the council recess. And looking forward to joining you all again in January 2nd.\nSpeaker 1: That motion.\nSpeaker 2: And I.\nSpeaker 0: Am not sure I could legislate something till next year.\nSpeaker 7: Maybe I could just ask for a resolution through the end of this year.\nSpeaker 0: Why don't I do that? I think I. This is a new one here. This is history in the making. So I will just once I can pull up my schedule.\nSpeaker 1: December 16th is our last. December 16th is our last summer season.\nSpeaker 0: So I'm going to I'm going to do it till December 16th. Can I. Okay. So I could do it all the way to generate twice a.\nSpeaker 7: Oh. Okay. Okay. Mr. President, it was more of an announcement, apparently. Okay. That I'd like to make her aware that I will be taking an apologetic.\nSpeaker 0: We'll let the record reflect the fact that cast members appropriately asked for leave, for absence for her leave. And we all agree and we'll work through the logistics of line.\nSpeaker 7: And I just want to say I wish all our colleagues the best of luck this fall. And to folks who are not coming back, it was a true honor to work with you. So thank you very much for all the work that you've done in our in our tenure together in the two years of my tenure together with you and do wish you all the best of luck and I'll be back. Everything goes correctly for potentially a budget vote or two in mid-November.\nSpeaker 0: Very good. I remember.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. And you know councilmember and said it's been my pleasure working with you as well over the last couple of years and I will reach out to you. And when you are prepared, I will send you a message. Say, call me back when the baby's asleep so we can talk about where we're going with this budget. And I appreciate your and your staff giving us your priorities and getting in your your first form A's. And you won't be out of the loop very far in advance.\nSpeaker 7: And thanks to the council colleagues for allowing me to be so vocal in the last few weeks as we've been talking about possible priorities, I wanted to make sure everybody knew the various priorities before heading out on family leave and no guarantees about being able to come back. But appreciate that the council rules were amended in December 2017 so that the assumption would be made that if anybody wanted to use the call in option during any family leave, they had the ability to do so. So we'll let you know as soon as possible. And otherwise, I look forward to seeing you soon.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Mosquito. And with that, we stand adjourned.

    "source": "Speaker 0: Agenda Item one Constable 119945 relating to civil service commissions, amending election procedures for the employing elected members of the Civil Service Commission and Public Safety Civil Service Commission, making temporary provisions for the 2020 elections. Amending Section 4.04.250 and 4.08.040 of the standards for code and ratifying and confirming search and prior acts. Thank you, Madam Chair. I moved to pass Council Bill 119945. Is there a second? Second? Thank you. It's been moved and seconded to pass the bill. Councilmember Herbold, you are the prime sponsor of the bill and are recognized in order to address this item. Thank you so much. As discussed earlier this morning in council briefings, this bill relates to both the Civil Service Commission and the Public Safety Civil Service Commission. Both entities have three members, one that's appointed by the mayor, one that's appointed by the council, and one that's elected by the relevant city employees for the Public Safety Civil Service Commission. That is police and fire employees for the Civil Service Commission. It is nonexempt employees who do not work for the mayor or council or civil service commission staff. Both entities are having elections this year and things are slightly delayed.\nSpeaker 2: By.\nSpeaker 0: COVID 19. So this legislation allows the city clerk to hold the elections in December rather than November. It allows for electronic ballots rather than only physical ballots, though the option of paper ballots will still remain, and the schedule changes only for 2020.

Councilmember Peterson, please.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, council president and thank you. Councilmember Herbold, a viewing public mind. I know, but during council briefing this morning, we talked a little bit about this particular council bill. And I want to thank Councilmember Herbold for clarifying and just want to point out to the public, the fiscal note does say that this legislation has contingent language to cover that. The Public Safety Civil Service Commission is because of the accountability ordinance from 2017, intended not to have any elected members in the future, so that this leaves open the possibility to implement that provision of the 2017 Accountability Police Accountability Ordinance, which I know several members on this Council were champions of that and authors of that. And so we, by passing this ordinance, are in no way signaling any sort of deviation from our commitment to implement the rest of that accountability ordinance, which which actually excluded employees from this commission. So thank you for clarifying that this morning.\nSpeaker 0: Great. Thank. Thanks so much, Casimir Peterson. Any other comments on the bill? Okay. Hearing. I appreciate the ongoing conversation here. I'm going to go ahead and ask the clerk to call the roll on the passage of the bill.\nSpeaker 2: Suarez i.\nSpeaker 0: Lewis.\nSpeaker 1: I.\nSpeaker 2: Morales I.\nSpeaker 0: Mosquera.

Thank you, Madam Clerk. That's what I'm asking you. You are the chair of this committee and are recognized once again to provide the committee's report on this bill. Thank you very much, Madam President. Collins. Item. Item number four on today's agenda. We talked about quite a bit this morning. This is related to the federal grants that we are accepting. There's a number of important federal grants that are accepted at the end of the year each year. There has been a document that was circulated this weekend by Greg Doss from central staff. And we appreciate all of the work that they did over the weekend to help answer questions that stemmed from the robust discussion in our committee meeting on Wednesday. One of the things that you should also note, in addition to the questions that we have submitted that resulted in 11 page response document, is that Director Noble has sent a letter today to make sure that if there are any additional questions that those get answered before those 2021 allocations are spent. And that's an important commitment from the CBO office, from Director Noble, that he has sent this letter to us, which you all should have received just around 2 p.m. today, to make sure that any additional questions specifically as well related to Homeland Security grants do get answered. As the council member, Strauss discussed this morning. There was a long conversation in Wednesday on Wednesday's meeting, and I do have additional concerns and questions that I will be submitting. Folks are asked by Alex Nucci and Greg Doss that if you do have additional questions that are not yet answered in that 11 page document, please make sure that you send your questions by Wednesday at noon so that central staff can coordinate with the office to answer any additional questions. I want to make sure, though, as Vice-Chair Herbal did during our committee last year, that folks know that there's a number of really important grants that are included in the overall bill as well, and we want to make sure to move this forward to accept those grants. With that, I will be voting yes and the committee voted 5 to 0, recommending passage during full council today. Thank you very much, Madam President. And you consider our musketeer for that excellent report while multitasking. Well done. Are there any additional comments on the bill? Councilmember Strauss and then Councilor, you want to go to Councilmember first? Okay. Councilmember Herbold and then Councilmember Strauss.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. I also want to make note of Budget Director Ben Noble's commitment in the Budget Committee meeting to do more work with the Council prior to the the development and submittal of grants that may be of concern to the Council. An example of the work that this Council has done around funding sources that are of concern relates specifically to legislation in 2017 that the Council adopted. You might remember that that year I proposed to create a new section of the municipal code prohibiting Seattle Police Department participation in the U.S. Department of Defense 1033 program that allows cities to transfer excess military equipment to civilian law enforcement agencies at no cost. This was a particular program that we had received concerns about, and in response, we, the chief, had had decided to no longer participate in that program. And then we sort of solidified that policy decision of of of chief best with this with this particular ordinance, I would suggest that our ongoing efforts to take a look at some of these grant sources might result in a request from the council to the department to no longer participate in in some of these grant sources. But I think that is really important work, and I appreciate that that we need to do moving forward. And I appreciate that we have a commitment from the Budget Director that we can take a deeper dove in the future before these grants are sought. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Oh, excellent. Thank you. Councilmember Herbold, Councilmember Strauss.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Council President. Thank you, Chairman Skater. And thank you. Also Chair Herbold. Also want to thank Director Noble for your letter. Your letter, as well as the conversation that I had with Greg Doss and Alex Nucci, have resolved the concerns that I have for today. And I will be following up with additional questions as per your letter has requested. I really just want to thank you, Director Noble, for sending that along and working with us in an expedient fashion as well. Again, a thank you to Dr. Fisher and Angela Sochi and Greg, for all of your work answering the 11 pages of questions over the weekend. Thank you, council president. I will be voting yes. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Now way to bury the lead counselor with Strauss. Thank you so much. Colleagues, are there any additional comments on the bill? Right. Hearing non-whites want to thank the chair and member Strauss and conservatives for their good work on getting as much information about this as we can. Lots more to always, particularly as it relates to oversight issues. So really look forward to the opportunity to continue to engage in that work. That being said, will the clerk please call the role on the passage of the.\nSpeaker 1: Bill you want?\nSpeaker 3: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Strauss. Yes. Herbal. Yes. Whereas I. Lewis. Yes. Morales. Yes. Or better.\nSpeaker 0: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Peterson. Yes.\nSpeaker 0: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Nine in favor and oppose.\nSpeaker 0: The bill passes and the chair will sign it.

Thank you, Madam Clerk. That's what I'm asking you. You are the chair of this committee and are recognized once again to provide the committee's report on this bill. Thank you very much, Madam President. Collins. Item. Item number four on today's agenda. We talked about quite a bit this morning. This is related to the federal grants that we are accepting. There's a number of important federal grants that are accepted at the end of the year each year. There has been a document that was circulated this weekend by Greg Doss from central staff. And we appreciate all of the work that they did over the weekend to help answer questions that stemmed from the robust discussion in our committee meeting on Wednesday. One of the things that you should also note, in addition to the questions that we have submitted that resulted in 11 page response document, is that Director Noble has sent a letter today to make sure that if there are any additional questions that those get answered before those 2021 allocations are spent. And that's an important commitment from the CBO office, from Director Noble, that he has sent this letter to us, which you all should have received just around 2 p.m. today, to make sure that any additional questions specifically as well related to Homeland Security grants do get answered. As the council member, Strauss discussed this morning. There was a long conversation in Wednesday on Wednesday's meeting, and I do have additional concerns and questions that I will be submitting. Folks are asked by Alex Nucci and Greg Doss that if you do have additional questions that are not yet answered in that 11 page document, please make sure that you send your questions by Wednesday at noon so that central staff can coordinate with the office to answer any additional questions. I want to make sure, though, as Vice-Chair Herbal did during our committee last year, that folks know that there's a number of really important grants that are included in the overall bill as well, and we want to make sure to move this forward to accept those grants.

I also want to make note of Budget Director Ben Noble's commitment in the Budget Committee meeting to do more work with the Council prior to the the development and submittal of grants that may be of concern to the Council. An example of the work that this Council has done around funding sources that are of concern relates specifically to legislation in 2017 that the Council adopted. You might remember that that year I proposed to create a new section of the municipal code prohibiting Seattle Police Department participation in the U.S. Department of Defense 1033 program that allows cities to transfer excess military equipment to civilian law enforcement agencies at no cost. This was a particular program that we had received concerns about, and in response, we, the chief, had had decided to no longer participate in that program.

So our next proclamation and last proclamation is the art and wine fair. This is the 35th anniversary of the Alameda Art and Wine Fair. So who's that? I see. Janet Maccabee, executive director of downtown Alameda Business Association. So come on now. Here's your proclamation. Where is the first? Alameda Art and Wine Fair was held 35 years ago on August three and four in 1984. And. Whereas, the event continues to be the largest street festival on the island, staffed by 200 volunteers each year, a total of 7000 volunteers and over 14000 hours of service over the past 35 years. And. Whereas, the event is co-produced by the downtown Alameda Business Association, Daubert, its board of Directors and member businesses and strum productions to raise funds to keep downtown Alameda clean, green and safe. And. Whereas, the event provides an opportunity for thousands of visitors and residents to discover our vibrant downtown districts, celebrate the creativity of Northern California artisans and sample locally crafted beer, wine and food. And. Whereas, more than 200 bands have performed live over the years and a local stage was added in 2018 to highlight Alameda based performers. And. WHEREAS, the event offers family friendly entertainment, including a Ferris wheel, bungee jump, water balls, kiddy train and puppet show. And. Whereas, to celebrate the 35th anniversary Dover will hold, will host a free showing of every poster from the fair's 35 year history collection at the Auto Body Fine Art Gallery on Park Street from July 17 to 28, 2019. So now, therefore, be it resolved that I, Marilyn, as the Ashcroft mayor of the city of Alameda, do hereby proclaim July 27 and 28 as the Art and Wine Fair's 35th anniversary in the city of Alameda and congratulate the downtown Alameda Business Association on their continued success and invite Alameda INS and visitors to enjoy the 2019 Art and Wine Fair. And with that, Ms.. Maccabee, would you like to say a few words?\nSpeaker 3: Yes, thank you. Madam Mayor, councilmembers and city staff. Thank you for acknowledging that. Acknowledging the 35th anniversary of the art and wine fair in historic downtown Alameda, the downtown Alameda Business Association Board of Directors, Board, committee staff and our event partner Equestrian Productions are most grateful for the years of support that this council and the many that have gone before have given. We are equally thankful for the support of the dedicated city staff, including but not limited to our police and fire departments. Permits and planning, public works, economic development as each have assisted us with the details necessary to pull off this major event. Many of you have volunteered and your time and your talents and you've stood by local residents that have also helped our loyal sponsors and community partners that have helped to fund this undertaking. Share this honor with our association. We'd like to acknowledge our downtown businesses who roll out the welcome mat for tens of thousands of people every time we put this event on. And so we are ever grateful to them for their hospitality. I hope you can all be there on the 27th and 28th. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: But difficult. I know you don't think congratulations like married.\nSpeaker 9: There were some issue with ABC which.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Next step is oral communications where we have a limited number of speakers may address the counsel regarding any matter not on the agenda and we have 15 minutes set aside for that and any additional public comment that doesn't happen in those 15 minutes will happen later in the agenda. So do we have any speakers?\nSpeaker 1: We have three.\nSpeaker 0: Three. So with three speakers you will each get 3 minutes. You never have to feel like you have to use all 3 minutes. But any. Would you want to call our speakers?\nSpeaker 1: Sure. Pat Potter Mackenzie. Tap and simmer.\nSpeaker 3: You don't know how tempted I am to continue my conversation on the car, but I won't.\nSpeaker 0: I'm not on the agenda.\nSpeaker 3: It's not on me anyway. I just wanted to point out that that the impression I got from that incredibly great city comment meeting at the Elks Lodge about carp was so well attended and the ideas were so fantastic. But the one thing I took away was that most people hadn't read the document. They wanted to tell you what they felt about climate and and that sort of thing, but they hadn't read the document, or they may have read the executive summary. And the reason is, is because this document is so heavy. I mean, it's so big. So what I'd like to suggest is that that every time you have a plan, when it's a draft, you make five copies of it, you give it to the library.",

Whereas, the event is co-produced by the downtown Alameda Business Association, Daubert, its board of Directors and member businesses and strum productions to raise funds to keep downtown Alameda clean, green and safe. And. Whereas, the event provides an opportunity for thousands of visitors and residents to discover our vibrant downtown districts, celebrate the creativity of Northern California artisans and sample locally crafted beer, wine and food. And. Whereas, more than 200 bands have performed live over the years and a local stage was added in 2018 to highlight Alameda based performers. And. WHEREAS, the event offers family friendly entertainment, including a Ferris wheel, bungee jump, water balls, kiddy train and puppet show. And. Whereas, to celebrate the 35th anniversary Dover will hold, will host a free showing of every poster from the fair's 35 year history collection at the Auto Body Fine Art Gallery on Park Street from July 17 to 28, 2019. So now, therefore, be it resolved that I, Marilyn, as the Ashcroft mayor of the city of Alameda, do hereby proclaim July 27 and 28 as the Art and Wine Fair's 35th anniversary in the city of Alameda and congratulate the downtown Alameda Business Association on their continued success and invite Alameda INS and visitors to enjoy the 2019 Art and Wine Fair. And with that, Ms.. Maccabee, would you like to say a few words?\\nSpeaker 3: Yes, thank you. Madam Mayor, councilmembers and city staff. Thank you for acknowledging that. Acknowledging the 35th anniversary of the art and wine fair in historic downtown Alameda, the downtown Alameda Business Association Board of Directors, Board, committee staff and our event partner Equestrian Productions are most grateful for the years of support that this council and the many that have gone before have given. We are equally thankful for the support of the dedicated city staff, including but not limited to our police and fire departments. Permits and planning, public works, economic development as each have assisted us with the details necessary to pull off this major event. Many of you have volunteered and your time and your talents and you've stood by local residents that have also helped our loyal sponsors and community partners that have helped to fund this undertaking. Share this honor with our association. We'd like to acknowledge our downtown businesses who roll out the welcome mat for tens of thousands of people every time we put this event on. And so we are ever grateful to them for their hospitality. I hope you can all be there on the 27th and 28th. Thank you.\\nSpeaker 1: But difficult. I know you don't think congratulations like married.\\nSpeaker 9: There were some issue with ABC which.\\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Next step is oral communications where we have a limited number of speakers may address the counsel regarding any matter not on the agenda and we have 15 minutes set aside for that and any additional public comment that doesn't happen in those 15 minutes will happen later in the agenda. So do we have any speakers?\\nSpeaker 1: We have three.\\nSpeaker 0: Three. So with three speakers you will each get 3 minutes. You never have to feel like you have to use all 3 minutes. But any. Would you want to call our speakers?\\nSpeaker 1: Sure. Pat Potter Mackenzie. Tap and simmer.\\nSpeaker 3: You don't know how tempted I am to continue my conversation on the car, but I won't.\\nSpeaker 0: I'm not on the agenda.\\nSpeaker 3: It's not on me anyway. I just wanted to point out that that the impression I got from that incredibly great city comment meeting at the Elks Lodge about carp was so well attended and the ideas were so fantastic. But the one thing I took away was that most people hadn't read the document. They wanted to tell you what they felt about climate and and that sort of thing, but they hadn't read the document, or they may have read the executive summary. And the reason is, is because this document is so heavy. I mean, it's so big. So what I'd like to suggest is that that every time you have a plan, when it's a draft, you make five copies of it, you give it to the library.\""

Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Very much. I just want to enter into the record the names of eight great young men who did a variety of community services towards earning their eagle Eagle Scout honor. And I just want to say that on June 26, on behalf of mayor, as he Ashcraft, I attended the Eagle Court of Honor that was held in the afternoon, Saturday afternoon.\nSpeaker 3: At Franklin.\nSpeaker 2: Park, where eight young Alameda INS were given. They had earned the Eagle rank. As a result, a variety of of community activities. I just wanted.\nSpeaker 3: For the record to enter their names.\nSpeaker 2: In and I hope that we make a practice of this.\nSpeaker 3: Going forward.\nSpeaker 2: These eight individuals are Henry Bank. Terry Banchory. Brendan Cook. Jonathan Hill dress. Andrew Jurek and his brother Eric Jurek, Zachary Quayle, Tibor Thompson and Vander von Stroheim. All of these individuals had to do a minimum of 25 community activities. And one of them, Jonathan Hildreth, did as much as I think it was, 45. So they did a lot of great things on behalf of the community in earning their Eagle Scout badge. And I believe our mayor has some experience in dealing with Eagle Scouts.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilmember de. And I really did appreciate you attending that Eagle Code of honor. I loved to attend them, but I just had a conference and couldn't be there. And it is really special. And yes, my son Cole is an Eagle Scout from Troop 89. But and I think, if I recall correctly from the emails, some of these young men would have gotten this award last year, but it was in the midst of COVID and so they couldn't meet. So it was kind of a combined combined group, but all really hardworking individuals and and I really appreciate you attending for me and I know you enjoyed it. Yeah, go ahead.\nSpeaker 2: If I could just say one more quick thing. And that was Boy Scout Troop.\nSpeaker 3: 73 in Alameda.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. Thank you. Councilmember Harris, Spencer James, for your handout. Yes.\nSpeaker 0: I I'd like to share that this Saturday, the 24th from 6 to 10 p.m. is Relay for Life at.\nSpeaker 1: Lydecker.\nSpeaker 0: Park. And they didn't have it last year, as far as I know. So for those of you that are supportive, it's because cancer doesn't sleep, that they do it annually as a reminder and just support those with cancer and survivors. And as we pass, the second point I wanted to share is I serve on the airport noise forum and they have actually created an app that you can use to report loud noises from planes to make it easier. If you go to the website, fly quiet. Okay. Okay. Dot com and scroll down. You'll see an app that you can load and then it's much easier to report the noise. And then finally, I wanted to share that this live Saturday at Nob Hill, there was the Boy Scout. Nathaniel Basco had come up with his Eagle Scout project, which is a piano for the community to share. It'll be available for three weeks at our side of Nob Hill. Then after that, I think it's going to be moved to a permanent location. And I want to also recognize Deirdre Freeman, the local artist who painted it for the project. So you're all welcome to go out there and play the piano. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. And thank you for reminding the community about Relay for Life this Saturday later carpark. And all right, now we are moving on up, so we are going to adjourn that special meeting. Bear with me audience and we are moving on to continued to the continued July six, 2021 Council meeting.",

I loved to attend them, but I just had a conference and couldn't be there. And it is really special. And yes, my son Cole is an Eagle Scout from Troop 89. But and I think, if I recall correctly from the emails, some of these young men would have gotten this award last year, but it was in the midst of COVID and so they couldn't meet. So it was kind of a combined combined group, but all really hardworking individuals and and I really appreciate you attending for me and I know you enjoyed it. Yeah, go ahead.\\nSpeaker 2: If I could just say one more quick thing. And that was Boy Scout Troop.\\nSpeaker 3: 73 in Alameda.\\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. Thank you. Councilmember Harris, Spencer James, for your handout. Yes.\\nSpeaker 0: I I'd like to share that this Saturday, the 24th from 6 to 10 p.m. is Relay for Life at.\\nSpeaker 1: Lydecker.\\nSpeaker 0: Park. And they didn't have it last year, as far as I know. So for those of you that are supportive, it's because cancer doesn't sleep, that they do it annually as a reminder and just support those with cancer and survivors. And as we pass, the second point I wanted to share is I serve on the airport noise forum and they have actually created an app that you can use to report loud noises from planes to make it easier. If you go to the website, fly quiet. Okay. Okay. Dot com and scroll down. You'll see an app that you can load and then it's much easier to report the noise. And then finally, I wanted to share that this live Saturday at Nob Hill, there was the Boy Scout. Nathaniel Basco had come up with his Eagle Scout project, which is a piano for the community to share. It'll be available for three weeks at our side of Nob Hill. Then after that, I think it's going to be moved to a permanent location. And I want to also recognize Deirdre Freeman, the local artist who painted it for the project. So you're all welcome to go out there and play the piano. Thank you.\\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. And thank you for reminding the community about Relay for Life this Saturday later carpark. And all right, now we are moving on up, so we are going to adjourn that special meeting. Bear with me audience and we are moving on to continued to the continued July six, 2021 Council meeting.\""

Permanent amount not to exceed 300,000.\nSpeaker 0: And I pulled this item. I don't know if staff wants to present anything about it. I pulled it because it's for up to 300,000 for structural engineer or an engineering firm. And it's my understanding that we, the city had had had an engineer through that, resigned in June. And so now we're being asked to approve a contract with a consulting firm out of San Mateo to make up for that. That would be up to 12 months and $300,000.\nSpeaker 2: So. Good evening. My name is Debbie Potter and I'm the city's community development director. And it is accurate that we had a plan check engineer that was working with the city. He actually resigned a year ago in June. So we have been using outside planned check services for several years now. We are using these planned check services. We are incredibly busy at the permit center and the flexibility that we have by using planned check services outside, planned check services we can use from one to 10 to 15 plan checkers all at the same time to keep moving our projects through the system. And while we do use planned check services, it should be noted that about 75% of all plan checking happens over the counter right here at City Hall. But 25% of our projects are complicated enough that they have to go out to a structural engineer. We're using CSG. It's the same plan check services that we that the fire department uses for its planned tech services. So that synergy has been very nice for us to have plan checkers that are very familiar with both the city's fire code and then all the building codes. We would like to continue on with the services that we are receiving from CSG. There is no impact on the general fund CSG. The contract is set up so that they charge 65% of the cost of the building permit, so that we are always providing services to applicants within the budget that we charge for building permits. It's no impact on the general fund and we will be continuing to look throughout this fiscal year at how we want to staff up that function within the department. And we're looking at perhaps keeping outside contract services and then possibly under filling the position with a plans examiner so we can do more over the counter. So we feel like we have an efficient model in place and it's really based on that analysis and the track record for the last year and a half that we're recommending approval of this contract for the current fiscal year.\nSpeaker 0: Do we have any engineers as part of our staff? Can you describe the types of engineers that we have as part of our staff?\nSpeaker 2: So the building official is has a degree in architecture, which is structural engineers and architects are the ones who can do the plan, check services. And then we have our supervising building inspector is a plan examiner, a certified plans examiner. So those are the two certified staff that we have.\nSpeaker 0: But do we have any engineers as part of our staff? That's actually my concern.\nSpeaker 2: We currently do not have a structural engineer, Madame Mayor. We have engineers in our public works department.\nSpeaker 0: Advanced planning. No, no, no. So that's that's where I'm that's where my question goes. My preference would be that we have at least one engineer on our staff. And it appears that that's counter to what the plan currently is with staff, that you plan to continue to have a consulting firm as opposed to an engineer that's actually an employee of the city, which I we used to have that and I and I think I've seen that that issue has been raised in regards to having an engineer as part of our planning department. So that was my concern. And I pulled out. And I actually think that the community is interested in this issue because there have been multiple letters to the editor regarding engineers as part of our planning department, separate from public works. And I appreciate that.\nSpeaker 2: Right. Most of those letters, though, are all about the public works engineers. Those letters that we've received have not been about the planning department. But I understand what you're saying, and we can take a look at it, because our building official, who has a degree in architecture, is able to do the same types of plan checking as a structural engineer it we just feel like it's more efficient to be able to access multiple structural engineers during our very busy period. And that's really what what we need and what we need. Internal to our staff are the certified plans examiners. And that's we also we do have several certified plans examiners on staff.\nSpeaker 0: And I appreciate that. Thank you for the comments.\nSpeaker 8: No, I just said I'm willing to move approval because I think Mr. Potter gave an excellent explanation if we want to keep these projects moving. Time is money. This is not impacting our general fund, and I think we're serving our community well. So with that, I will move approval of item five after recommendation to authorize the Interim City Manager to execute an agreement with CSG consulting services for professional plant services for a 12 month term in an amount not to exceed $300,000.\nSpeaker 0: We have a second.\nSpeaker 3: Second. All right.\nSpeaker 0: Any other comments? All those in favor.\nSpeaker 3: I think you.\nSpeaker 0: Of motion passes 4 to 1. Thank you. Thank you. And now we have speakers on five. Q And five are with you.\nSpeaker 1: And five Q is a final passage of ordinance amending the Alameda Municipal Code by adding article? What does that 14 to Chapter six concerning review of rent increases.",

Permanent amount not to exceed 300,000.\nSpeaker 0: And I pulled this item. I don't know if staff wants to present anything about it. I pulled it because it's for up to 300,000 for structural engineer or an engineering firm. And it's my understanding that we, the city had had had an engineer through that, resigned in June. And so now we're being asked to approve a contract with a consulting firm out of San Mateo to make up for that. That would be up to 12 months and $300,000.\nSpeaker 2: So. Good evening. My name is Debbie Potter and I'm the city's community development director. And it is accurate that we had a plan check engineer that was working with the city. He actually resigned a year ago in June. So we have been using outside planned check services for several years now. We are using these planned check services. We are incredibly busy at the permit center and the flexibility that we have by using planned check services outside, planned check services we can use from one to 10 to 15 plan checkers all at the same time to keep moving our projects through the system. And while we do use planned check services, it should be noted that about 75% of all plan checking happens over the counter right here at City Hall. But 25% of our projects are complicated enough that they have to go out to a structural engineer. We're using CSG. It's the same plan check services that we that the fire department uses for its planned tech services. So that synergy has been very nice for us to have plan checkers that are very familiar with both the city's fire code and then all the building codes. We would like to continue on with the services that we are receiving from CSG. There is no impact on the general fund CSG. The contract is set up so that they charge 65% of the cost of the building permit, so that we are always providing services to applicants within the budget that we charge for building permits. It's no impact on the general fund and we will be continuing to look throughout this fiscal year at how we want to staff up that function within the department. And we're looking at perhaps keeping outside contract services and then possibly under filling the position with a plans examiner so we can do more over the counter. So we feel like we have an efficient model in place and it's really based on that analysis and the track record for the last year and a half that we're recommending approval of this contract for the current fiscal year.\nSpeaker 0: Do we have any engineers as part of our staff? Can you describe the types of engineers that we have as part of our staff?\nSpeaker 2: So the building official is has a degree in architecture, which is structural engineers and architects are the ones who can do the plan, check services. And then we have our supervising building inspector is a plan examiner, a certified plans examiner. So those are the two certified staff that we have.\nSpeaker 0: But do we have any engineers as part of our staff? That's actually my concern.\nSpeaker 2: We currently do not have a structural engineer, Madame Mayor. We have engineers in our public works department.\nSpeaker 0: Advanced planning. No, no, no. So that's that's where I'm that's where my question goes. My preference would be that we have at least one engineer on our staff. And it appears that that's counter to what the plan currently is with staff, that you plan to continue to have a consulting firm as opposed to an engineer that's actually an employee of the city, which I we used to have that and I and I think I've seen that that issue has been raised in regards to having an engineer as part of our planning department. So that was my concern. And I pulled out. And I actually think that the community is interested in this issue because there have been multiple letters to the editor regarding engineers as part of our planning department, separate from public works. And I appreciate that.\nSpeaker 2: Right. Most of those letters, though, are all about the public works engineers. Those letters that we've received have not been about the planning department. But I understand what you're saying, and we can take a look at it, because our building official, who has a degree in architecture, is able to do the same types of plan checking as a structural engineer it we just feel like it's more efficient to be able to access multiple structural engineers during our very busy period. And that's really what what we need and what we need. Internal to our staff are the certified plans examiners. And that's we also we do have several certified plans examiners on staff.\nSpeaker 0: And I appreciate that.

Okay. Do we have any comments? And I just want to comment. I said I think I said this when I introduced these names of these individuals last week, that I am just overwhelmed and so heartened and gratified. And I know council would share my sentiments with the quantity and the quality of applicants we're getting. And I'm talking to our different staff who staffs our different boards and commissions. And we think it's a combination of, you know, it's COVID 19. People are working from home, so maybe they have a little more time to focus on some local issues. But I think with all the layers of issues we've been dealing with since the spring, people have really focused on how can I make a difference? And one of the things I love hearing when I'm interviewing and I always conduct the interviews with whoever the city staff is who staffs that Border Commission. But if people are saying they just want to give back, they love living here, they want to give back. And I'm really excited that we have a combination of folks who've lived here while we've got newcomers, and they all bring so much talent and energy to the to the table. So thank you all and welcome. And so, Madam Clerk, this is where and I see we've got Adam Gillett, who's a graphic artist who is on he's returning. He is the current president of the Public Art Commission.

I pulled this item because I think it is worthy of our hearing here in the public. This is a endeavor that is very important to North Lawn Beach communities, particularly those neighborhoods surrounding the Market Avenue corridor.

Councilmember Andrews This is a project that's very near and dear to Councilmember Austin's heart. And I'm going to turn it over to our sustainability manager, Larry Rich, to tell us what's happening. Thank you, Mr. West. Good evening, Mayor, and members of the Council. One of the things that we do in the Office of Sustainability is always looking for grant opportunities to pursue either for funding or, in this case, technical assistance. And so and this particular grant opportunity, the organization Global Green reached out to us and invited us to apply for a program that they're doing that's called the Sustainable Neighborhood Assessment. This is the third year of their program. In the past two years, they've selected in each of the years, seven or eight other cities around the country. This year they were looking for another seven or eight cities. And so Long Beach applied. We in working with the Development Services Department and looking into previous planning efforts, we selected a neighborhood in in the eighth District in the vicinity of Market Street and the Virginia Village right there at Market and Language Boulevard. And so what this is all about is we previously interacted with Global Green to create our green building policy for both municipal development and private development. And in that policy, we use a tool called the Lead Checklist LEED being leadership in energy and environmental design. So at this point in the city of Long Beach, we've got more than 30 LEED certified buildings, some of which are city owned facilities such as Fire Station 12 or the gas and oil building that was recently completed. There's a there's a different product that we're not as familiar with that's called LEED for Neighborhood Development. So over the course of this grant technical assistance, we will be doing a assessment of this neighborhood around Market Street with a mind to what sort of strengths the neighborhood has, what sort of green opportunities exist. And we will be provided with a report and assessment at the end of the process that will make recommendations to the city about how it might proceed with development projects in that neighborhood to introduce green elements such as pedestrian friendliness, stormwater improvements, open space linkages and so on. The technical assistance involves an intensive three day site visit by the Global Green Experts, where we'll do. A city team will be assembled to work with the Global Green team. We'll do a walk the neighborhood to get a feel for what's going on, on the ground, review the existing plans that have been completed for the area, run through the the lead for neighborhood development checklist to review opportunities there, hold a couple or a stakeholder meeting and also a an evening community input meeting and then tie all that information together in what I've seen done for the other cities that have completed this process, a 20 to 25 page report that then comes back to the city and it'll be on us to implement recommendations that are made in that report. So that's a kind of a quick overview of what we're talking about for this neighborhood. We're excited in the Office of Sustainability because, as I said, we don't necessarily have experience with the lead for neighborhood development tool. So it'll be a good learning experience for city staff and hopefully we'll pick up some things through this process that will be applicable to neighborhoods across the city. That's the end of my report and I'm ready for any questions.\nSpeaker 5: Well, I'll just give you a comment and say, you know, I'm looking forward to this. I know many of our residents are looking forward to it. And as you say, stakeholders as well in the area. I think this project will this assessment will help tie in Virginia Village. Which has already seen significant city investment. On that with the Forest Wetlands Project is coming to Earth as well. And so Market Street is a is a is a priority for this.

We'll do a walk the neighborhood to get a feel for what's going on, on the ground, review the existing plans that have been completed for the area, run through the the lead for neighborhood development checklist to review opportunities there, hold a couple or a stakeholder meeting and also a an evening community input meeting and then tie all that information together in what I've seen done for the other cities that have completed this process, a 20 to 25 page report that then comes back to the city and it'll be on us to implement recommendations that are made in that report. So that's a kind of a quick overview of what we're talking about for this neighborhood. We're excited in the Office of Sustainability because, as I said, we don't necessarily have experience with the lead for neighborhood development tool. So it'll be a good learning experience for city staff and hopefully we'll pick up some things through this process that will be applicable to neighborhoods across the city. That's the end of my report and I'm ready for any questions.\nSpeaker 5: Well, I'll just give you a comment and say, you know, I'm looking forward to this. I know many of our residents are looking forward to it. And as you say, stakeholders as well in the area. I think this project will this assessment will help tie in Virginia Village. Which has already seen significant city investment. On that with the Forest Wetlands Project is coming to Earth as well. And so Market Street is a is a is a priority for this.

        "\"Speaker 3: Okay. Item six, click or read item six.\\nSpeaker 4: This is a report from the city manager with the recommendation to authorize the city manager execute documents with Global Green for professional technical assistance to conduct a sustainable neighborhood assessment for the historic Virginia Village Market Street Neighborhood District eight.\\nSpeaker 3: Straws.\\nSpeaker 5: Yes, Mr. Mayor, thank you very much. I pulled this item because I think it is worthy of our hearing here in the public. This is a endeavor that is very important to North Lawn Beach communities, particularly those neighborhoods surrounding the Market Avenue corridor. I wanted to let staff report exactly on what this Global Green Initiative is actually all about. And so I turn it over to the city manager.\\nSpeaker 8: Mayor. Councilmember Andrews This is a project that's very near and dear to Councilmember Austin's heart. And I'm going to turn it over to our sustainability manager, Larry Rich, to tell us what's happening. Thank you, Mr. West. Good evening, Mayor, and members of the Council. One of the things that we do in the Office of Sustainability is always looking for grant opportunities to pursue either for funding or, in this case, technical assistance. And so and this particular grant opportunity, the organization Global Green reached out to us and invited us to apply for a program that they're doing that's called the Sustainable Neighborhood Assessment. This is the third year of their program. In the past two years, they've selected in each of the years, seven or eight other cities around the country. This year they were looking for another seven or eight cities. And so Long Beach applied. We in working with the Development Services Department and looking into previous planning efforts, we selected a neighborhood in in the eighth District in the vicinity of Market Street and the Virginia Village right there at Market and Language Boulevard. And so what this is all about is we previously interacted with Global Green to create our green building policy for both municipal development and private development. And in that policy, we use a tool called the Lead Checklist LEED being leadership in energy and environmental design. So at this point in the city of Long Beach, we've got more than 30 LEED certified buildings, some of which are city owned facilities such as Fire Station 12 or the gas and oil building that was recently completed. There's a there's a different product that we're not as familiar with that's called LEED for Neighborhood Development. So over the course of this grant technical assistance, we will be doing a assessment of this neighborhood around Market Street with a mind to what sort of strengths the neighborhood has, what sort of green opportunities exist. And we will be provided with a report and assessment at the end of the process that will make recommendations to the city about how it might proceed with development projects in that neighborhood to introduce green elements such as pedestrian friendliness, stormwater improvements, open space linkages and so on. The technical assistance involves an intensive three day site visit by the Global Green Experts, where we'll do. A city team will be assembled to work with the Global Green team. We'll do a walk the neighborhood to get a feel for what's going on, on the ground, review the existing plans that have been completed for the area, run through the the lead for neighborhood development checklist to review opportunities there, hold a couple or a stakeholder meeting and also a an evening community input meeting and then tie all that information together in what I've seen done for the other cities that have completed this process, a 20 to 25 page report that then comes back to the city and it'll be on us to implement recommendations that are made in that report.

Just the next item on the agenda.\nSpeaker 0: Item two, I was communication from Councilwoman Price, Councilmember Spano, Councilman Andrews and Councilmember Turanga. Recommendation to require a city manager to develop a free voluntary bike registration program by partnering with Project 5 to 9.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. I can have everyone just say we're going to keep moving the agenda as we exit. So please. Councilwoman Price.\nSpeaker 6: I'm not.

Beck.\nSpeaker 1: This is a quick one.\nSpeaker 6: Well, I'll go ahead and get started since I think our colleagues have probably read the TFF already, but I'm glad to be bringing this item back before the City Council to establish a city wide bike registration program. As you may recall, I brought the initial item before council asking staff to provide a report on the feasibility of developing a free online voluntary bicycle registration program. They Richards staff returned with a report on March the eighth recommending that a bike registration organization called Project 5 to 9 would offer the greatest ability to deliver a robust, low cost bicycle registry program to our residents. Since 2011, the city has not required registration of bicycles. The registration program was cumbersome and difficult for residents to comply with. However, today, bicycle thefts are serious and growing concern throughout Long Beach. So a new approach is needed. Currently, many residents do not record this information for their bicycles, so if their bicycle is stolen, they are unable to provide the police department with detailed information that could result in the return of the bicycle. Additionally, if a bicycle is registered.\nSpeaker 1: The.\nSpeaker 6: Police department would be better able to proactively return stolen bikes to their owners when they are found, as well as prosecute those committing bike thefts. The police department currently has a large number of recovered bicycles that are unregistered, with no way of contacting the owners. And free and voluntary online bike registration programs.\nSpeaker 1: Will give.\nSpeaker 9: The police.\nSpeaker 6: Department a better chance of returning stolen bikes and confronting the.\nSpeaker 1: Bike theft problem head.\nSpeaker 6: On. Addressing bike thefts has become a big focus for me because every day we see bikes stolen and there is little the police can do to address this. If they cannot prove ownership of a bike and the crime goes unreported, stolen bikes are chronically used as currency for drug purchases, primarily the drugs that we've seen them used for purchases for as heroin and methamphetamine. So bike registration gives police an important tool to fight a number of issues, while also improving our ability to return bikes to their owners. The costs for us to be involved in this program is minimal, considering that we're servicing a city of 500,000 residents. And I see that Mr. Becker's here. So I don't know if Mr. Beck wants to offer any additional comments that I didn't cover.\nSpeaker 4: Councilmember Apologize. Yes. I think moving forward with an online bicycle program is the best approach. We have worked with our colleagues in the police department. They are very supportive of going in this direction and we look forward to getting it up and running for the community in.\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. I don't have any further comments. I ask my colleagues to support us. This is, in my opinion, as as our city manager often says, motherhood and apple pie.

But our infrastructure is intact. Isn't the most effective regarding bike ownership or theft? You know, I believe a streamlined process for this registration will support our recovery effort and hopefully encourage more residents to ride their bikes.

But our infrastructure is intact. Isn't the most effective regarding bike ownership or theft? You know, I believe a streamlined process for this registration will support our recovery effort and hopefully encourage more residents to ride their bikes. So I'm excited about seeing this progress in program, you know, coming to action. Thank you, Councilman Price.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.

        "\"Speaker 4: Motion carries. Thank you very much. Thank you. And we will. We're going to go ahead and move on to item 12, please. Just the next item on the agenda.\\nSpeaker 0: Item two, I was communication from Councilwoman Price, Councilmember Spano, Councilman Andrews and Councilmember Turanga. Recommendation to require a city manager to develop a free voluntary bike registration program by partnering with Project 5 to 9.\\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. I can have everyone just say we're going to keep moving the agenda as we exit. So please. Councilwoman Price.\\nSpeaker 6: I'm not. Is there anyone left from public works that might be able to.\\nSpeaker 1: Speak about this?\\nSpeaker 4: I know Mr. Beck is here. Do we want to grab Mr. Beck? We're going to grab Mr.. Mr.. Beck.\\nSpeaker 1: This is a quick one.\\nSpeaker 6: Well, I'll go ahead and get started since I think our colleagues have probably read the TFF already, but I'm glad to be bringing this item back before the City Council to establish a city wide bike registration program. As you may recall, I brought the initial item before council asking staff to provide a report on the feasibility of developing a free online voluntary bicycle registration program. They Richards staff returned with a report on March the eighth recommending that a bike registration organization called Project 5 to 9 would offer the greatest ability to deliver a robust, low cost bicycle registry program to our residents. Since 2011, the city has not required registration of bicycles. The registration program was cumbersome and difficult for residents to comply with. However, today, bicycle thefts are serious and growing concern throughout Long Beach. So a new approach is needed. Currently, many residents do not record this information for their bicycles, so if their bicycle is stolen, they are unable to provide the police department with detailed information that could result in the return of the bicycle. Additionally, if a bicycle is registered.\\nSpeaker 1: The.\\nSpeaker 6: Police department would be better able to proactively return stolen bikes to their owners when they are found, as well as prosecute those committing bike thefts. The police department currently has a large number of recovered bicycles that are unregistered, with no way of contacting the owners. And free and voluntary online bike registration programs.\\nSpeaker 1: Will give.\\nSpeaker 9: The police.\\nSpeaker 6: Department a better chance of returning stolen bikes and confronting the.\\nSpeaker 1: Bike theft problem head.\\nSpeaker 6: On. Addressing bike thefts has become a big focus for me because every day we see bikes stolen and there is little the police can do to address this. If they cannot prove ownership of a bike and the crime goes unreported, stolen bikes are chronically used as currency for drug purchases, primarily the drugs that we've seen them used for purchases for as heroin and methamphetamine. So bike registration gives police an important tool to fight a number of issues, while also improving our ability to return bikes to their owners. The costs for us to be involved in this program is minimal, considering that we're servicing a city of 500,000 residents. And I see that Mr. Becker's here. So I don't know if Mr. Beck wants to offer any additional comments that I didn't cover.\\nSpeaker 4: Councilmember Apologize. Yes. I think moving forward with an online bicycle program is the best approach. We have worked with our colleagues in the police department. They are very supportive of going in this direction and we look forward to getting it up and running for the community in.\\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. I don't have any further comments. I ask my colleagues to support us. This is, in my opinion, as as our city manager often says, motherhood and apple pie. Thank you.\\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Councilmember Supernormal.\\nSpeaker 4: I support.\\nSpeaker 3: This item.\\nSpeaker 4: Wholeheartedly.\\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Councilman Andrew.\\nSpeaker 11: Yes.

And the guy said, Listen, I've got a better place to sign that. And Zuckerberg said, Fine, here we go. They hopped in the car, went about 20, 20 minutes, 20 miles away, and it was a vacant building. And that was the only obstacle.\\nSpeaker 3: Is there any relevance to.\\nSpeaker 2: Yes, it's just a sweet thing to keep in mind. All of the vacant buildings, the Social Security office where he used to get food stamps and like Martin Luther King, he took the contract that that sealed the deal, signed it to the grill and the door and signed it. So that it's just a sweet thing on this. I'm going to make this suggestion. If the city clerk and the city attorney can fashion what I'm about to say into something that is acceptable. Now I know the state the city declares a state of emergency many times. I'm going to suggest that the city, this council. After listening to the city fashioning and having the city attorney examine it together with the clerk. Declare a state of emergency. Postpone. The election for one year, during which time the city will hire a retired US federal judge. Obviously not from the ninth Circuit. To help bring this, we put the city back on a sound footing. And a year from now. Go back to the public. And that's based upon the fact that every day I hear from more and more people and. Both sides of the aisle. The overwhelming sentiment is the two choices we have in terms of the mayoral election, and that's all I'm talking about, the mayoral election. The two choices are simply putrid, period. And I find it astonishing. That within what was once a great city, we can't find two people again.\\nSpeaker 0: Regardless of what side of the aisle we got.\\nSpeaker 3: It was a good year. Time's expired. Thank you. I think we know your sentiments on this.\\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. I'm quite sure you do.\\nSpeaker 3: We know that you are quite done. All right. Members, we have a motion in the second on item. Item 11, please cast your votes.\\nSpeaker 0: There are four resolutions.\\nSpeaker 4: Associated with that in a letter that so moved on. All of them.\\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. Let's do it. All right. Okay. Mr. City Attorney, can we move? Yes.\\nSpeaker 4: So moved.\\nSpeaker 0: Charlie.\\nSpeaker 3: Okay. All right. Yes, ma'am. Mr. Vice Mayor.\\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. I actually just wanted to acknowledge I think we have a pure in the audience to watch this. We have our new incoming school board member, Megan Curran, who was here. And we also have our councilmember elect, Robert Arango, who is here as well. And so I just wanted to point out that their.\\nSpeaker 3: Congratulations to you both.\\nSpeaker 0: Congratulations.\\nSpeaker 1: Councilmember Lowenthal and I wanted to extend my congratulations as well to both of them and looking forward to working with you both. Thank you.\\nSpeaker 3: Good luck. Nice job. All right, members, cast your votes on all four.\\nSpeaker 2: Motion carry symbol. Yes.\\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. We'll now go to new business.

Since 1939, the present Naples sea walls have been standing and they've stood the test of time. But more than 18 years ago, the city had prudently paid attention to the cries from homeowners in the Naples Improvement Association, and they had done several studies. One of them was the Cash and Associates, and one of them was the Moffatt and Nickel Report. And when I was president of the Nhia, they came to a meeting and they told people that we have walls that are deteriorating and we have to do something about them quickly. And they had an estimate that it would cost about 78 million to do the entire island. And with neighborhood volunteers, we came together and formed a seawall committee and about 20 people have consistently, once a month for 18 years every month, come together to provide input and to work with the city. And public works has been very receptive and responsive to our requests. And talking about these public seawalls, the city council is always provided us with continual funding during that time period to work on road repair. And there was a study done by the State Lands Commission and the city. There was a study prepared by transit systems and that particular one, the gentleman who was doing it, could even pull the wall pieces out by hand. So it was at that point it was in imminent danger of failure. And so six phases of a project were established at that time and moved ahead. Tetra Tech developed the phases in pieces and then the Coastal Commission looked at it. And through the help of Councilman DeLong and through continued help of our vice mayor here, he worked on the committee on the commission, the Coastal Commission, and helped to formulate the ways that we could get a project through that would be on the water side, because we were looking at the birds that nested the created creatures in the water. We looked at the public access and make sure that public access was being addressed. And so the plan that has been finally come up and it's taken more than eight years to pull it together, is now before you. And we know that we don't want to spend any more money on studies, and we know that this is a good use of the Thailande fund for public access to our waterways and the Coastal Commission blessed it. And we'd like you to bless it tonight.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Thank you, Maureen, for all your work and the other public comments. Sea none believe there's a motion on the floor for item 12.

Tetra Tech developed the phases in pieces and then the Coastal Commission looked at it.

We looked at the public access and make sure that public access was being addressed. And so the plan that has been finally come up and it's taken more than eight years to pull it together, is now before you. And we know that we don't want to spend any more money on studies, and we know that this is a good use of the Thailande fund for public access to our waterways and the Coastal Commission blessed it. And we'd like you to bless it tonight.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Thank you, Maureen, for all your work and the other public comments. Sea none believe there's a motion on the floor for item 12.

        "\"Speaker 0: Item 12 item calls a recommendation to adopt plans and specifications for the Naples Island permanent seawall repairs.\\nSpeaker 1: So moved a motion and a second. Any public comment on the item? Mr. Goodhue.\\nSpeaker 4: An up.\\nSpeaker 9: Very good. You click as the address. I support the concept in chief and I've studied the plan for doing it and moving forward in this first phase.\\nSpeaker 0: And I think it makes it eminent sense.\\nSpeaker 9: And I think also the mitigation plan for this first section makes sense. I'm not sure about the mitigation for the balance of the program, but at least for this sense that makes and for this first phase, it makes sense where the problem comes up. Excuse me.\\nSpeaker 4: 1/2 and. Where the problem.\\nSpeaker 9: Surfaces is in the the funding of it. And I support using tidelands funds. But I think the city is going to find itself in a position of not being able to use those tidelands funds pending the given the specter of the pending indictment and arrest the Vice mayor. Commissioner. Coastal Commissioner Garcia. There are some details handed out here relative to that, and next week I'll go further into it. But I think the city needs to examine methods of financing at it other than the Tidelands Agency, because I think the requisite authorities that have the ability to do so are going to put the foot on the neck until they clean up the corruption that is set forth in not only here, but this comes on the heels, of course, as you know, the chief counsel for the Department of Boating Waterways caught the city trying to illegally use money to benefit friends of Bob Foster in the Long Beach Yacht Club. That does not instill confidence. So I think it's foolish to move forward counting on the Tidelands funds until they get a master in here to clean up the shop. I think they've come to realize now that the potential dollars that we're talking about here are approaches, approaches that which has resulted in the increase in the incarceration of the people in Bell. The instant issue here that brings it into focus is to S and the Marine stadium that was put forward that saying it was an epicenter of crime. The police reports clearly that are in your hands now showing that there's no crime. The building is secured at night with iron curtains, £200 each. All of both of which are chained with chain and steel at night. There is no crime. It was a ruse to make a gift to $300,000 to a few select people. That is going to hold up, I believe, the use of tidelands funds. Thank you.\\nSpeaker 1: Vice Chair Councilors if I can, to point out as a city manager, we have no idea what.\\nSpeaker 2: Mr. Good he is talking about. Any of the allegations just made are just made up. We have no idea. We never heard about this. So I just want to make that very, very clear that we have no idea what he's talking about.\\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Next speaker, please. Break the chains.\\nSpeaker 6: Good evening, Council and vice mayor. I appreciate you letting me speak today. Maureen Poe from 144 7:00 Naples. Since 1939, the present Naples sea walls have been standing and they've stood the test of time. But more than 18 years ago, the city had prudently paid attention to the cries from homeowners in the Naples Improvement Association, and they had done several studies. One of them was the Cash and Associates, and one of them was the Moffatt and Nickel Report. And when I was president of the Nhia, they came to a meeting and they told people that we have walls that are deteriorating and we have to do something about them quickly. And they had an estimate that it would cost about 78 million to do the entire island. And with neighborhood volunteers, we came together and formed a seawall committee and about 20 people have consistently, once a month for 18 years every month, come together to provide input and to work with the city. And public works has been very receptive and responsive to our requests. And talking about these public seawalls, the city council is always provided us with continual funding during that time period to work on road repair. And there was a study done by the State Lands Commission and the city. There was a study prepared by transit systems and that particular one, the gentleman who was doing it, could even pull the wall pieces out by hand. So it was at that point it was in imminent danger of failure. And so six phases of a project were established at that time and moved ahead. Tetra Tech developed the phases in pieces and then the Coastal Commission looked at it. And through the help of Councilman DeLong and through continued help of our vice mayor here, he worked on the committee on the commission, the Coastal Commission, and helped to formulate the ways that we could get a project through that would be on the water side, because we were looking at the birds that nested the created creatures in the water. We looked at the public access and make sure that public access was being addressed. And so the plan that has been finally come up and it's taken more than eight years to pull it together, is now before you. And we know that we don't want to spend any more money on studies, and we know that this is a good use of the Thailande fund for public access to our waterways and the Coastal Commission blessed it.

Recommendation to Request City Attorney to prepare a resolution to oppose Proposition six. The voter approval for future gas and vehicle taxes and 2017 tax repeal initiative citywide.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Ringo.\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Given the importance that SB one has provided for not only the city limits, but for the state as a whole, I think it's very important that we oppose this proposition because it would have a devastating effect on all the projects that we currently have going in the city alone, which because of SB one, and when you look at what's going on with the replacement bridge at the replacement Desmond Bridge, it would be a bridge going to nowhere if we didn't have the funds to finish that project. And we have as well some other projects in Long Beach, including the Long Beach Boulevard and Pacific Coast Highway and a lot of other projects that we have because of SB one. So I would strongly suggest let's just so strongly support the city council opposing measure. I mean, Proposition six.\nSpeaker 0: Becky, there's a motion and a second seconded by Councilman Austin. Councilman Austin.\nSpeaker 8: Yes. I'd also like to just weigh in and say, I think it's important for us to to stand by what we've worked for as a council and support it for for several years. It was the Fix Our Roads kind of campaign through the League of California Cities, a lot of our legislative advocacy for infrastructure support and dollars for state highways, but also for local roads as well, that this these dollars actually will go a long way, if I'm not mistaken. Stephanie, can you tell me specifically how much if SB six does pass, how much we would stand to lose as a city?\nSpeaker 2: Diana Chang.\nSpeaker 1: Good morning, Mayor.\nSpeaker 5: And Members of the City Council. SB 145 19 We've budgeted $8 million for.\nSpeaker 1: Projects in all nine council districts, and so those revenues would would likely.\nSpeaker 7: Be.\nSpeaker 5: Repealed and, and the projects would be without.\nSpeaker 1: A source of dedicated funding.\nSpeaker 8: So that's that's $8 million annually, correct?\nSpeaker 1: It's $8 million for FY 19.\nSpeaker 7: And as the revenues continue to be implemented as part of SB one, we're expecting them to grow to.\nSpeaker 5: 11 million in about FY 20 and then indexed to inflation thereafter. I would also like to note that this essentially doubles what the city currently receives from the state for streets.\nSpeaker 3: Streets and.\nSpeaker 1: Roads.\nSpeaker 5: Currently with just hooda the traditional source of state funding for streets and roads. Our our budget, it's about 10 million annually. So with SB one, we add another eight for FY19.\nSpeaker 7: About 11 for FY 20, and then adjusted to inflation every year thereafter.\nSpeaker 8: So I think it's a the the, the gas tax that we have is a small price to pay for, for good infrastructure investing in our future. The impact would be obviously significant for our public works infrastructure budget. And if we didn't if we lost those dollars, we'd have to be made up elsewhere. We and that would be less dollars that we could actually put toward residential streets, which I think are so important to our residents. And so for those reasons, I support this this motion to support to support or oppose. SB I'm to be very clear to oppose SB six.\nSpeaker 0: Six and let me add one thing that wasn't, I think unless I missed it in Dana Takes presentation, which is that the SB one not just not only includes all the street work and the annual funding that comes in, but they're also doing specific, larger streets. And part of SB one separate of what we're getting annually this year is the entire reconstruction of PCH from our entrance point in Orange County, all the way through the city to our exit point in in western Long Beach. And so that is a project that the state's doing that's in Long Beach that doesn't count towards our our amount. And so that that's a huge project that is obviously incredibly, incredibly expensive. And so that's why work goes through most of the city. There's a motion of seconds are public comment on this item saying none please cast your votes.",

        "\"Speaker 1: Motion carries.\\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Item 22.\\nSpeaker 1: Report from City Manager. Recommendation to Request City Attorney to prepare a resolution to oppose Proposition six. The voter approval for future gas and vehicle taxes and 2017 tax repeal initiative citywide.\\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Ringo.\\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Given the importance that SB one has provided for not only the city limits, but for the state as a whole, I think it's very important that we oppose this proposition because it would have a devastating effect on all the projects that we currently have going in the city alone, which because of SB one, and when you look at what's going on with the replacement bridge at the replacement Desmond Bridge, it would be a bridge going to nowhere if we didn't have the funds to finish that project. And we have as well some other projects in Long Beach, including the Long Beach Boulevard and Pacific Coast Highway and a lot of other projects that we have because of SB one. So I would strongly suggest let's just so strongly support the city council opposing measure. I mean, Proposition six.\\nSpeaker 0: Becky, there's a motion and a second seconded by Councilman Austin. Councilman Austin.\\nSpeaker 8: Yes. I'd also like to just weigh in and say, I think it's important for us to to stand by what we've worked for as a council and support it for for several years. It was the Fix Our Roads kind of campaign through the League of California Cities, a lot of our legislative advocacy for infrastructure support and dollars for state highways, but also for local roads as well, that this these dollars actually will go a long way, if I'm not mistaken. Stephanie, can you tell me specifically how much if SB six does pass, how much we would stand to lose as a city?\\nSpeaker 2: Diana Chang.\\nSpeaker 1: Good morning, Mayor.\\nSpeaker 5: And Members of the City Council. SB 145 19 We've budgeted $8 million for.\\nSpeaker 1: Projects in all nine council districts, and so those revenues would would likely.\\nSpeaker 7: Be.\\nSpeaker 5: Repealed and, and the projects would be without.\\nSpeaker 1: A source of dedicated funding.\\nSpeaker 8: So that's that's $8 million annually, correct?\\nSpeaker 1: It's $8 million for FY 19.\\nSpeaker 7: And as the revenues continue to be implemented as part of SB one, we're expecting them to grow to.\\nSpeaker 5: 11 million in about FY 20 and then indexed to inflation thereafter. I would also like to note that this essentially doubles what the city currently receives from the state for streets.\\nSpeaker 3: Streets and.\\nSpeaker 1: Roads.\\nSpeaker 5: Currently with just hooda the traditional source of state funding for streets and roads. Our our budget, it's about 10 million annually. So with SB one, we add another eight for FY19.\\nSpeaker 7: About 11 for FY 20, and then adjusted to inflation every year thereafter.\\nSpeaker 8: So I think it's a the the, the gas tax that we have is a small price to pay for, for good infrastructure investing in our future. The impact would be obviously significant for our public works infrastructure budget. And if we didn't if we lost those dollars, we'd have to be made up elsewhere. We and that would be less dollars that we could actually put toward residential streets, which I think are so important to our residents. And so for those reasons, I support this this motion to support to support or oppose. SB I'm to be very clear to oppose SB six.\\nSpeaker 0: Six and let me add one thing that wasn't, I think unless I missed it in Dana Takes presentation, which is that the SB one not just not only includes all the street work and the annual funding that comes in, but they're also doing specific, larger streets. And part of SB one separate of what we're getting annually this year is the entire reconstruction of PCH from our entrance point in Orange County, all the way through the city to our exit point in in western Long Beach. And so that is a project that the state's doing that's in Long Beach that doesn't count towards our our amount. And so that that's a huge project that is obviously incredibly, incredibly expensive. And so that's why work goes through most of the city. There's a motion of seconds are public comment on this item saying none please cast your votes.\""

So, Madam Clerk, the hearing, please.\nSpeaker 1: Hearing item one is a report from Development Services recommendation to receive supporting documentation into the record. Conclude the public hearing and adopt resolution. Amending the master fee and charges schedule citywide.\nSpeaker 0: Mr. West, who's who's doing this?\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Staff report will be given by Linda Tatum.\nSpeaker 2: Good afternoon, Mayor, and members of the Council. This item is a public hearing to consider a resolution to modify the city's master fee schedule for development services by reducing selected entitlement fees and adopting new fees related to the mailing of public hearing notices. As you recall, on September 18th, 2018, the City Council adopted an ordinance that amended various sections of the zoning code related to conditional use permits, and it also. This action that the Council took at that time also updated the public notification requirements. Since then, our staff has evaluated the specific entitlement application fees, which currently include the cost for mailed public hearing notices. So of what we found from that analysis is that approximately $950 of the current application fees go toward the costs of producing and mailing these public notices. So adoption of this resolution would effectively unbundle the noticing fees from the application fee for most of the entitlement applications that we process. This resolution would also establish a tiered fee structure for mailing public notices going forward. The proposed fee reduction is $950 less than the current application fees and the new publication or the new public noticing fees range from $410 for the standard 300 foot noticing radius for Tier one. And this is explained in a little bit more detail in your staff report. But there's also a Tier two noticing four or 500 foot radius, and that is whenever a project is within 300 feet of a residential development and it goes up to Tier three, which is $950 for noticing whenever a project is 750 feet or greater from any application that addresses either a reduction of parking, shared parking or a project where there is a code requirement for some kind of distance buffering, like in a tattoo parlor as an example. So I just want to make sure that you're aware that this particular action will address mail notices, but it does not change any of the other standard notices that staff provides, and these include posting the notices in City Hall. We also post individual development sites with those large noticing posters. We also notice post notice on the city's website. We also notify city council offices as well as neighborhood organizations for all of the required public noticing for discretionary approvals. So I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of that. And we feel that the proposed resolution tonight balances the direction of the council to reduce the costs of the conditional use permit process. But we think that it also provides ample notification to the to the public for discretionary actions. So staff recommends that the city council adopt the proposed resolution to reduce the application fees and also to establish the new tiered fee schedule for public noticing. That concludes the presentation. But I'm here as well as Lisa Falls, our Administrative Services Bureau manager, who assisted on this project. And we can respond to any questions you have.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. I got a motion in a second. Let me just do is there any public comment first seen a public comment? Councilor Pearce.\nSpeaker 6: I just want to say great job staff are really tackling how to reduce those costs in a creative way.

But also beyond that to what renters care about citywide. And that is things like transit. Rotation, public health and safety parks and open space education and other topics that renters in our city engage on.

The Commission will be staffed through the Department of Neighborhoods and assuming this passes and the mayor signs it, which I believe he will, outreach about the commission and applications for individuals who would like to be appointed to the commission will begin in April. We hope that we can complete that in May or early June and the Commission can start meeting early this summer. There's been a lot of talk about the renter's commissioner and whether we need the renters commissioner or don't need the renters commission. Some have suggested that this is an anti landlord move. That's certainly not the case. We just want to give renters a formal voice here at City Hall. And as I said last week in discussing this, renters need landlords and landlords need renters. And so if this commission can help bridge that relationship, then that'll be a positive move for our city. So council members Herbold, O'Brien and Suarez have joined me in sponsoring this legislation and we urge its adoption.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much for the comments, COUNCILMEMBER. Whereas.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Before I begin, I do want to have a special thank you to Zack DeWolf for his leadership and boldness, not only for the residents of Capitol Hill and the community and all the all the projects that he works on, but also taking on a big project for all the residents of Seattle. Again, as we say in Indian Country, my hands are up to you. Thank you. I just want to point out that the demographics of our city have changed a lot over the years. I think it's important to note. In my district alone, we now have 49% renters and 51% homeowners. And I believe that those people should have a voice. It's important that renters are, recognize and are engaged in the city process and certainly in the decisions. City commissions are a way of establishing a clear commitment to engage with communities who have a stake in the work of the city. Similarly to the new Community Involvement Commission, I believe this new commission will broaden the city's ability to increase and deepen the contributions of citizens to our legislative decisions. I was grateful to co-sponsor this legislation and I'm happy to vote in favor of today. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Because member o'brien.\nSpeaker 3: Councilmember suarez said everything i was going to say much more elegantly. But thank you all so much for your advocacy.

So all three of these bills are basically giving the mayor the authority to implement a collective bargaining agreement between three different union bodies. All three of these agreements were established within the parameters established by the Seattle councils, the City Council's Labor Relations Committee. So the first one is an agreement between the public service and industrial employees. Local 1239. That agreement will last till the end of December 2018. And I should probably should have said that I am filling in for Councilmember Burgess in his absence on this legislation. That particular agreement with one, two, three nine affects up to 125 regular sitting employees and up to 225 active temporary employees. The second counts, Bill 118646 is between the city and the Teamsters local union. 117 And I think all of you are familiar with 117 and the agreement affects up to 15 regular city employees and up to 200 active temporary employees. Again, that agreement will last through the end of 12th December 2018. In the last bill, 118644 is between the city and the Washington State Council of County and City Employees f. S CME Local 21. And that agreement again last to the end of December 2018, and that affects up to 150 regular city employees. And contrary to some of the public testimony that you heard today, we believe that these these agreements are acceptable to the employees, that their ability to to unionize and be a strong member of their respective unions strengthens our entire city and is for the benefit of our workers who mean the most to us. And so the certainly we recommend approval of these three agreements, which are all consistent with the parameters set by the Council's Labor Relations Committee. I move to pass in Lester.
