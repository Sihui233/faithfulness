The agency argues that it would require consent before tax returns could be sent overseas for processing or disclosed to third parties.

And then you sign the consent and your record is now being sold to a database company.\nSYLVESTER: It's hard to see why consumers would want to have their information sold.\nBETH MCCONNELL, PENN. PIRG: I think it's incredibly significant, not only given the epidemic of identity theft that affects more than 9 million Americans every single year, but also just the barrage of marketing and advertising that consumers are already having a hard time controlling.\nSYLVESTER: Consumer groups say for individuals, there's nothing to gain by having their records sold and everything to lose.\nSYLVESTER: H&R; Block did not return our calls for comment on this story.

My name's Kevin Kennedy. I'm the city treasurer. Madame Mayor. Happy belated birthday. Thank you. City Council. Just to give you a quick update on Wells Fargo, as the report indicates, we did sell the positions that we had in Wells Fargo as of June 30th. So the portfolio does not hold. Any Wells Fargo securities in it, which was the the direction we got from counsel. Last spring.\nSpeaker 0: And can you clarify, was there any loss to the city for doing that?\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you'll see. On page two of the report, uh, it lists out three bonds that we sold to them. We sold it at a small gain. One, we sold at a loss. Net net, it was about a $2,000 loss, which sounds like a lot of money, but it was a million and a half dollars worth of bonds . So if you take it as a percentage, I think it's about a 10th of a percent. So it wasn't it wasn't a big financial event for the portfolio at all. But it does divest us from from the Wells Fargo investments.\nSpeaker 0: And then, has that money been reinvested?\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Yes. And Wells Fargo is on the you should call it the no buy list and until further indication. So our managers are aware of that.\nSpeaker 0: And do you believe that you're able to find comparable investments so that the long term will not be a financial loss to the city to have done that?\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. You know, the value that they sold at is a factor of interest rates. So, you know, in theory, the interest rates were a little bit higher than when they bought the bonds. So they probably turned around and bought another bond with the interest rates high. I don't think that's a big issue and it's just one issue. Granted, as we've talked about, the the universe of bonds that we can invest in because of our strict credit rating requirements and stuff is fairly limited. But taking one issue or out of that mix probably doesn't affect the portfolio in the long run.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Any other questions from vice mayor?\nSpeaker 4: It's not really a question. I just wanted to say thank you to both you and Elena for your work on this. And, you know, I think that it's tremendous that not only did we say we were going to do something, but we've actually taken action and we did it in a way that was fiscally savvy for our city. So thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Absolutely. And I want to also echo that it was commending our council for moving forward on this item. I think it was important. Yes, I believe it was a referral, yes. From vice mayor and member already. Yes. So thank you. All right. So thank you very much. And now do we have a motion to accept three?\nSpeaker 4: I'll make the motion to accept a3p second.\nSpeaker 0: All those in favor I motion carries unanimously. Thank you.

I think that motion carries that was three a an hour here in regards to three B, which is the recommendation to accept the investment report for the quarter ending June 30th, 2017.\nSpeaker 1: And Kevin Kennedy is here. Can talk about it. And Elena Adair. Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\nSpeaker 2: You're better than at the moment.\nSpeaker 0: So thank you for being here this evening.\nSpeaker 2: Of course. Thank, Alina. My name's Kevin Kennedy. I'm the city treasurer. Madame Mayor. Happy belated birthday. Thank you. City Council. Just to give you a quick update on Wells Fargo, as the report indicates, we did sell the positions that we had in Wells Fargo as of June 30th. So the portfolio does not hold. Any Wells Fargo securities in it, which was the the direction we got from counsel. Last spring.\nSpeaker 0: And can you clarify, was there any loss to the city for doing that?\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you'll see. On page two of the report, uh, it lists out three bonds that we sold to them. We sold it at a small gain. One, we sold at a loss. Net net, it was about a $2,000 loss, which sounds like a lot of money, but it was a million and a half dollars worth of bonds . So if you take it as a percentage, I think it's about a 10th of a percent. So it wasn't it wasn't a big financial event for the portfolio at all. But it does divest us from from the Wells Fargo investments.\nSpeaker 0: And then, has that money been reinvested?\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Yes. And Wells Fargo is on the you should call it the no buy list and until further indication. So our managers are aware of that.\nSpeaker 0: And do you believe that you're able to find comparable investments so that the long term will not be a financial loss to the city to have done that?\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. You know, the value that they sold at is a factor of interest rates. So, you know, in theory, the interest rates were a little bit higher than when they bought the bonds. So they probably turned around and bought another bond with the interest rates high. I don't think that's a big issue and it's just one issue. Granted, as we've talked about, the the universe of bonds that we can invest in because of our strict credit rating requirements and stuff is fairly limited. But taking one issue or out of that mix probably doesn't affect the portfolio in the long run.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Any other questions from vice mayor?\nSpeaker 4: It's not really a question. I just wanted to say thank you to both you and Elena for your work on this. And, you know, I think that it's tremendous that not only did we say we were going to do something, but we've actually taken action and we did it in a way that was fiscally savvy for our city. So thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Absolutely. And I want to also echo that it was commending our council for moving forward on this item. I think it was important. Yes, I believe it was a referral, yes. From vice mayor and member already. Yes. So thank you. All right. So thank you very much. And now do we have a motion to accept three?\nSpeaker 4: I'll make the motion to accept a3p second.\nSpeaker 0: All those in favor I motion carries unanimously. Thank you. I will now adjourn this special FCIC meeting and we will now open the regular city council meeting.\nSpeaker 1: Raqqa has been noted.

This referral came from Councilmember Ody and Brody.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you for being at such a late hour. I'll try to be brief so we can get out of here. So just as a little bit of background, MTC, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission recently contracted with a company to operate the bike share program and expanded from 700 bicycles to 7000 bicycles are doing this in Oakland, San Francisco , San Jose, Emeryville and Berkeley. Unfortunately, Alameda is not part of that. I know the MBC was looking to expand it to other cities and I would just like to get the sense of the council to instruct staff that if MTC is still looking to expand this or if they're looking to expand this in the future, you know that Alameda make an effort to participate because I think we really are of all of the cities in the Bay Area the most bikeable and you know bike sharing for those that don't know it like city car share where you can pick up a car, you know, take it somewhere and drop it off. Same thing with bike sharing and get on a bike. I think somebody even mentioned it not at the last meeting, but in the previous meeting. You know, that they can just hop on a bike, you know, ride over to Alameda Point, drop it off, you know, pick up another one later. So I know it's not like the biggest issue facing the council today and this month, but I think it's something that, you know, given our our geography and our topography as being flat and the way all of Alameda loves biking and reducing car emissions, that is something that we consider being a part of in the future.\nSpeaker 0: Member Ashcraft.\nSpeaker 4: I'm a big fan of city bike share programs. When I visit my kids in Washington, D.C., I pack my helmet and I use the city bike share there, and it's really reasonably priced. And I would also love to see allow me to be a part of it. I wondered if this is something we wanted to present to the Transportation Commission, to perhaps even study and put together a proposal for MTC just because they handle those sorts of things. And but I certainly agree with Councilmember Ody that we are a flat city. We've got the topography, we are adding more bike lanes all the time. And we constantly are trying to get people out of their cars and onto alternate means of transportation, both to reduce our traffic, to improve their health and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which is our responsibility as elected leaders. But I'm just wondering whether this might appropriately reside with the Transportation Commission.\nSpeaker 3: So I think any anything that we do on this matter would clearly end up not end up there, but find their way there and then on to the council. So we would be absolutely sure to include the Transportation Commission on anything we do on this.\nSpeaker 0: Though, could staff look at and so I don't know how MTC arrived at what cities or if cities had to pay any moneys to participate, could start, look into it and then just maybe report back to us or how would staff propose we go forward on the site and.\nSpeaker 3: We would definitely want to take a look at how they identified the cities. And also, was there a cost to participating? And if there was, how much and do we think that we could you know, obviously, if there's some monetary implication, we would want to talk to the council about that, too. So we'll bring it back in and take a look at, you know, we need to analyze the program and how they identified the cities.\nSpeaker 0: And I want to thank member Ody for bringing this to him as a referral. I think that's a great idea.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Member de SAC.\nSpeaker 6: Yes, I think we should certainly take a look at this and as part of the review of it, also make sure to involve outfits that at this point in time rent out bikes in Alameda, of which there might be several. Particularly one on an offshore onshore island drive near the McDonald's restaurant. So I'm sure it's not an either or situation, but if we just make sure that we work it in, you know, everyone can turn out a winner.\nSpeaker 5: And Rudy in the staff report. You know, there were a lot of different, you know, issues like, for example, not taking away parking meters, space, things like that. So a lot of this has to be evaluated. But it would be nice if Alameda. Yeah. Could be at least at the table and and be one of the possible future sites for this.\nSpeaker 0: That concludes that item in. Yes. You're good. All right.

So just as a little bit of background, MTC, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission recently contracted with a company to operate the bike share program and expanded from 700 bicycles to 7000 bicycles are doing this in Oakland, San Francisco , San Jose, Emeryville and Berkeley. Unfortunately, Alameda is not part of that.

Same thing with bike sharing and get on a bike. I think somebody even mentioned it not at the last meeting, but in the previous meeting. You know, that they can just hop on a bike, you know, ride over to Alameda Point, drop it off, you know, pick up another one later.

When I visit my kids in Washington, D.C., I pack my helmet and I use the city bike share there, and it's really reasonably priced. And I would also love to see allow me to be a part of it. I wondered if this is something we wanted to present to the Transportation Commission, to perhaps even study and put together a proposal for MTC just because they handle those sorts of things. And but I certainly agree with Councilmember Ody that we are a flat city. We've got the topography, we are adding more bike lanes all the time. And we constantly are trying to get people out of their cars and onto alternate means of transportation, both to reduce our traffic, to improve their health and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which is our responsibility as elected leaders. But I'm just wondering whether this might appropriately reside with the Transportation Commission.\nSpeaker 3: So I think any anything that we do on this matter would clearly end up not end up there, but find their way there and then on to the council. So we would be absolutely sure to include the Transportation Commission on anything we do on this.\nSpeaker 0: Though, could staff look at and so I don't know how MTC arrived at what cities or if cities had to pay any moneys to participate, could start, look into it and then just maybe report back to us or how would staff propose we go forward on the site and.\nSpeaker 3: We would definitely want to take a look at how they identified the cities. And also, was there a cost to participating? And if there was, how much and do we think that we could you know, obviously, if there's some monetary implication, we would want to talk to the council about that, too. So we'll bring it back in and take a look at, you know, we need to analyze the program and how they identified the cities.\nSpeaker 0: And I want to thank member Ody for bringing this to him as a referral.

So I'm sure it's not an either or situation, but if we just make sure that we work it in, you know, everyone can turn out a winner.\nSpeaker 5: And Rudy in the staff report.

You know, that they can just hop on a bike, you know, ride over to Alameda Point, drop it off, you know, pick up another one later. So I know it's not like the biggest issue facing the council today and this month, but I think it's something that, you know, given our our geography and our topography as being flat and the way all of Alameda loves biking and reducing car emissions, that is something that we consider being a part of in the future.\nSpeaker 0: Member Ashcraft.\nSpeaker 4: I'm a big fan of city bike share programs. When I visit my kids in Washington, D.C., I pack my helmet and I use the city bike share there, and it's really reasonably priced. And I would also love to see allow me to be a part of it. I wondered if this is something we wanted to present to the Transportation Commission, to perhaps even study and put together a proposal for MTC just because they handle those sorts of things. And but I certainly agree with Councilmember Ody that we are a flat city. We've got the topography, we are adding more bike lanes all the time. And we constantly are trying to get people out of their cars and onto alternate means of transportation, both to reduce our traffic, to improve their health and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which is our responsibility as elected leaders. But I'm just wondering whether this might appropriately reside with the Transportation Commission.\nSpeaker 3: So I think any anything that we do on this matter would clearly end up not end up there, but find their way there and then on to the council. So we would be absolutely sure to include the Transportation Commission on anything we do on this.\nSpeaker 0: Though, could staff look at and so I don't know how MTC arrived at what cities or if cities had to pay any moneys to participate, could start, look into it and then just maybe report back to us or how would staff propose we go forward on the site and.\nSpeaker 3: We would definitely want to take a look at how they identified the cities. And also, was there a cost to participating? And if there was, how much and do we think that we could you know, obviously, if there's some monetary implication, we would want to talk to the council about that, too. So we'll bring it back in and take a look at, you know, we need to analyze the program and how they identified the cities.\nSpeaker 0: And I want to thank member Ody for bringing this to him as a referral. I think that's a great idea.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Member de SAC.\nSpeaker 6: Yes, I think we should certainly take a look at this and as part of the review of it, also make sure to involve outfits that at this point in time rent out bikes in Alameda, of which there might be several. Particularly one on an offshore onshore island drive near the McDonald's restaurant. So I'm sure it's not an either or situation, but if we just make sure that we work it in, you know, everyone can turn out a winner.\nSpeaker 5: And Rudy in the staff report. You know, there were a lot of different, you know, issues like, for example, not taking away parking meters, space, things like that. So a lot of this has to be evaluated. But it would be nice if Alameda. Yeah. Could be at least at the table and and be one of the possible future sites for this.\nSpeaker 0: That concludes that item in. Yes. You're good. All right. We're going to move on then.\nSpeaker 6: I mean.\nSpeaker 0: You had direction with that.\nSpeaker 4: There's consensus.",

You may remember that you voted last year to approve the Denver preschool tax for another decade, I believe. But what we do in our elections for sales taxes is we try to predict how much money the city is going to get, both from the tax and overall as a city. So we can tell the voters, according to TABOR. And in this case, we I think I'm looking at David, I think we got it right on the sales tax amount, but we were a little low in what the city would take in overall. And so what that means is we need your permission again, because we told you what we thought we were going to take in. We hope that you will tell us again that we should keep the money that we collected for the preschool and use it to get kids head start in life and get them learning their ABCs and safe and quality child care during their start before school.

        "source":"Speaker 1: All right. We're moving right along here. And last but not least, let's get let's get bills to find a reduction. 553. Great. Councilwoman Kenny had a question. Okay, good or no?\nSpeaker 10: I'm sorry. A comment. I correct myself. No vote, though. No vote. Thank you, Mr. President. So 553 this is actually a measure we are referring to the ballot. So for the hundreds of thousands of viewers at home, I thought it was important that we tell you why. We're sending you a question about the Denver preschool program to the ballot. You may remember that you voted last year to approve the Denver preschool tax for another decade, I believe. But what we do in our elections for sales taxes is we try to predict how much money the city is going to get, both from the tax and overall as a city. So we can tell the voters, according to TABOR. And in this case, we I think I'm looking at David, I think we got it right on the sales tax amount, but we were a little low in what the city would take in overall. And so what that means is we need your permission again, because we told you what we thought we were going to take in. We hope that you will tell us again that we should keep the money that we collected for the preschool and use it to get kids head start in life and get them learning their ABCs and safe and quality child care during their start before school. But this will be a vote tonight in our block vote. It appears to send this to you as voters. And so just wanted to make sure folks knew why. And we will need your support to make sure that preschool money keeps in the budget.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. You know what? Thank you so much, Councilman Kennedy, for for bringing that up. And we know that kids get a start in preschool, gives them a head start in first and second grade. And so that is data that is proof. So thank you so much for that. Okay. All other bills for introduction are order published. We're ready for the block votes. Councilman Herndon, will you please put the resolution on the floor for adoption?\nSpeaker 3: Certainly will. Mr. President, I move that the following resolutions be adopted in a block off series of 2016 601607 372 591 598 604 611 593 595 596.\nSpeaker 1: All right. It has been moved and seconded.

Councilman Hern, please put the bills on final considerations on the floor for final passage.\nSpeaker 3: Yes, Mr. President. I move that the following bills for introduction. We place upon final consideration and do pass in a block. I'm sorry. Bill's on final consideration.\nSpeaker 2: Do pass, please. On vaccination, do pass. And waiting for the screen.\nSpeaker 3: There we go. I'll series 2016 553 564 515 589.\nSpeaker 1: Great. It has been moved in second, third roll call.\nSpeaker 5: Can each. Lopez New Ortega.

        "source":"SAMBOLIN: Welcome back. Fifteen minutes past the hour. We are following breaking news this morning. It is a shocking story involving the blade runner, Olympic and Paralympic track superstar Oscar Pistorius. He is at the police station in south Africa right now after his model girlfriend was shot and killed inside his home. Police are saying a 26-year-old man has been arrested. They are not confirming that it is Pistorius, although it is important to note that Pistorius is 26 years old. We are also finding out about previous incidents at his home of a domestic nature. Pistorius, who is a double amputee, reached the 400-meter semifinals in the London Games last year. He races with carbon blades because of a birth defect.\nBERMAN: To New York now where first it was calorie counts on menus, then trans fats, then mega soft drinks. Now, Mayor Michael Bloomberg is out to ban Styrofoam food packaging in stores. It's actually not Styrofoam technically, it's plastic foam. He's looking to ban that in stores and food restaurants. Bloomberg will unveil the plan today in his final State of the City speech.\nSAMBOLIN: And, boy, did you feel that breeze? Look at this. A boxer has suspended for allegedly taking a dive 13 seconds into a fight against former NFL defensive end Ray Edwards. Look at this, the phantom upper cut misses his much smaller opponent Nick \"Turbo Tax\" Capes by about a foot. But he sells it, literally knocking himself off his own feet. Reports say \"Turbo Tax\" --\nBERMAN: That is insane, I'm sorry. It is nowhere near him.\nSAMBOLIN: I know. But it looked right. So, if you're far away.\nBERMAN: Two miles away.\nSAMBOLIN: \"Turbo Tax\" was a last-minute replacement for a couple of no-show boxers. North Dakota's fight governing body is reviewing that right there. It won't take long to jump into a conclusion dare, I say, right?\nBERMAN: Not a tough one to review. Everyone waking up to a huge business story, a massive deal in the airline industry. U.S. Airways and bankrupt American Airlines have agreed to a merger.\nSAMBOLIN: But what does it mean for you, the flier? Christine Romans has details in \"Road Warriors\".\nCHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Because it's all about us in the end, isn't it? The goal is a more efficient, more profitable airline, but that's going to take some time. Airline mergers generally take a few years, so for now get ready for some logistical headaches. One analyst we talked to says the bigger the merger, the more problems there are. First, combining the computer systems isn't easy. So, there could be some reservation problems initially. We can look at one of the most recent mergers for a clue. United and Continental -- in January, 2012, the first month the government combined data of those carriers, it showed customer complaints shot up 198 percent. Most of the complaints are about flight problems, cancellations, delays and reservations and ticketing problems. These two airlines also have to combine their frequent flier programs. They're going to have to woo back business travelers that American lost with all of those canceled flights this fall because of a pilot sickout. Here's travel expert Mark Murphy on some of the benefits of the deal.\nMARK MURPHY, TRAVEL EXPERT: This merger will provide the traveler with better connections. I think you're going to be in nine major hubs between the two carriers now with the merger. So you're going to be able to get where you want to go more efficiently and effectively.\nROMANS: All right. So those nine major hubs are all over the country giving people a lot of access. Look at where they are. Not a lot of overlap. Really the only overlap in Chicago and Phoenix. Because of that and because the economy is still weak, many travel experts are telling us that ticket prices probably won't go up. Now, we should also point out that sources close to the boards have told us that the boards have agreed there's a lot of work to do here. An announcement today likely and then we'll wait to se what the bankruptcy judge says and what federal regulators say about this big, big deal.\nBERMAN: Usually changes need to be made before it's finalized but they manage to push it through.\nROMANS: That's right. Absolutely.\nSAMBOLIN: John pointed out perhaps they could double our miles. So --\nROMANS: No details on your frequent flier plan but I will find out as soon as this deal is official.\nSAMBOLIN: We appreciate that. Thank you. All right. Nineteen minutes past the hour. Coming up, lots of folks watching the news of that Carnival cruise ship limping back to port today. Christine Romans is coming back to tell us what you need to know if you are holding tickets for a cruise.",

So you're going to be able to get where you want to go more efficiently and effectively.\nROMANS: All right. So those nine major hubs are all over the country giving people a lot of access. Look at where they are. Not a lot of overlap. Really the only overlap in Chicago and Phoenix. Because of that and because the economy is still weak, many travel experts are telling us that ticket prices probably won't go up. Now, we should also point out that sources close to the boards have told us that the boards have agreed there's a lot of work to do here. An announcement today likely and then we'll wait to se what the bankruptcy judge says and what federal regulators say about this big, big deal.\nBERMAN: Usually changes need to be made before it's finalized but they manage to push it through.\nROMANS: That's right. Absolutely.\nSAMBOLIN: John pointed out perhaps they could double our miles. So --\nROMANS: No details on your frequent flier plan but I will find out as soon as this deal is official.\nSAMBOLIN: We appreciate that. Thank you. All right. Nineteen minutes past the hour.

        "source":"MICHAELA PEREIRA, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back to NEW DAY. Medical professionals remain shocked that a 15-year-old boy can survive a 5- 1\/2 hour flight from California all the way to Hawaii in the wheel well of a Boeing 767. Although it is very rare, the teen would not be the first to live through this kind of journey. Back in 2000, a man survived a 7-1\/2-hour flight from Tahiti to Los Angeles in the wheel well of a plane. Joining me now is the very physician who successfully treated that stowaway, Dr. Armand Dorian. Dr. Dorian, what a pleasure to have you here. Why don't you describe to us the condition of the stowaway survivor that presented to you in the E.R. back in 2000?\nDR. ARMAND DORIAN, USC VERDUGO HILLS HOSPITAL: Back in 2000, the patient that rolled in by paramedics was not in the same state as this young boy this year. He was literally frozen, almost cartoonishly frozen. His arms were kind of jutted out. He was moaning. He was unconscious. He was not alert. We had to do multiple critical measures to keep him alive. His core body temperature was below 80 degrees. We had to intubate him, put chest tubes in. It was really touch and go.\nPEREIRA: It was really a miracle that he survived in your estimation?\nDORIAN: There's no question. I thought in my lifetime I would never even hear of another case like this, let alone hear of a case where the gentleman who was a stowaway walks away from the incident.\nPEREIRA: Let's get to that. You already compared the difference between that. Quickly, before we move on, do you know if that man had lasting side effects? Oftentimes you don't know the results many years later. Do you know?\nDORIAN: Actually he had no gross motor dysfunction, so something may actually be -- later on that may come up like depression, chronic headaches, but nothing obvious at the time when he was discharged from the hospital. Know that it was a month after he was admitted.\nPEREIRA: Interesting. OK, to this 15-year-old, he essentially after an hour after the plane landed sort of came out of the wheel well mostly able to move on his own power. This is phenomenal. Talk to me about what you think happened that this young man would present in a very different condition than the man in 2000.\nDORIAN: I mean, the planets all were aligned. This was a perfect storm of disaster that actually probably saved his life because when the airplane ascends, you lose oxygen, the air gets thin as we would say in layman's terms. You would pass out in about a minute after being up there. Also, the temperature drops. With the temperature dropping it actually starts slowing down your body's need for oxygen. It puts you in a frozen or some people termed it as a suspended state. Kind of like a cryogenic freezing that we've seen, you know, sci-fi or hear about in the future happening and because your demand decreases, you don't need as much oxygen. You can be suspended in time until your oxygen is replenished.\nPEREIRA: We know your patient passed out and doesn't remember a thing of his flight. We don't what this young boy remembers. We know that he did tell police that he was unconscious for a time. What do you think it feels like for all of this to go on or do we know that because most people don't have a memory of it?\nDORIAN: I'm pretty sure he's not going to have any memory or recollection of it. He's going to probably remember the adrenaline rush of trying to hide inside that wheel well, the beginning of that takeoff, and then about a minute max, 5 minutes after that takeoff he's unconscious. The next thing he remembers, he's waking up and he's landed already. Maybe he thinks he didn't take off. He passed out and is in a completely different place.\nPEREIRA: How unusual is it, Dr. Dorian, for a person to survive subzero temperatures, lack of oxygen for 5-1\/2 hours and also that he didn't fall out of the landing gear.\nDORIAN: I kind of describe it as winning the lottery five times in a row. The fashion in which he did it, I would think it was a poor TV show production if they had a kid walk out of a wheel well like this. It's really mind-boggling.\nPEREIRA: The story he was telling us, he was trying to get home to Somalia to see his mother. You can imagine the heartbreak. You can imagine the concern the family has. Hopefully he'll get medical attention to deal with any issues that come up after this. Dr. Dorian, what a pleasure to talk to you. Some miracles stories we are talking about. Thanks for joining us from Los Angeles -- Chris.\nCUOMO: That just does not make sense. I don't know how that kid managed to not have any effects of such extreme conditions. Let's take a little break on NEW DAY to consider it. When we come back, an object of interest on the shoreline of Western Australia. Could it be debris from Flight 370?\nBOLDUAN: The death toll continues to rise in the South Korean ferry disaster. Why did so many victims fail to get out alive? We'll take you inside a simulator to get a better understanding of the life-or- death emergency at sea.",

ARMAND DORIAN, USC VERDUGO HILLS HOSPITAL: Back in 2000, the patient that rolled in by paramedics was not in the same state as this young boy this year. He was literally frozen, almost cartoonishly frozen. His arms were kind of jutted out. He was moaning. He was unconscious. He was not alert. We had to do multiple critical measures to keep him alive. His core body temperature was below 80 degrees. We had to intubate him, put chest tubes in. It was really touch and go.\nPEREIRA: It was really a miracle that he survived in your estimation?\nDORIAN: There's no question. I thought in my lifetime I would never even hear of another case like this, let alone hear of a case where the gentleman who was a stowaway walks away from the incident.\nPEREIRA: Let's get to that. You already compared the difference between that. Quickly, before we move on, do you know if that man had lasting side effects? Oftentimes you don't know the results many years later. Do you know?\nDORIAN: Actually he had no gross motor dysfunction, so something may actually be -- later on that may come up like depression, chronic headaches, but nothing obvious at the time when he was discharged from the hospital. Know that it was a month after he was admitted.\nPEREIRA: Interesting. OK, to this 15-year-old, he essentially after an hour after the plane landed sort of came out of the wheel well mostly able to move on his own power. This is phenomenal. Talk to me about what you think happened that this young man would present in a very different condition than the man in 2000.\nDORIAN: I mean, the planets all were aligned. This was a perfect storm of disaster that actually probably saved his life because when the airplane ascends, you lose oxygen, the air gets thin as we would say in layman's terms. You would pass out in about a minute after being up there. Also, the temperature drops. With the temperature dropping it actually starts slowing down your body's need for oxygen. It puts you in a frozen or some people termed it as a suspended state. Kind of like a cryogenic freezing that we've seen, you know, sci-fi or hear about in the future happening and because your demand decreases, you don't need as much oxygen. You can be suspended in time until your oxygen is replenished.\nPEREIRA: We know your patient passed out and doesn't remember a thing of his flight. We don't what this young boy remembers. We know that he did tell police that he was unconscious for a time. What do you think it feels like for all of this to go on or do we know that because most people don't have a memory of it?\nDORIAN: I'm pretty sure he's not going to have any memory or recollection of it. He's going to probably remember the adrenaline rush of trying to hide inside that wheel well, the beginning of that takeoff, and then about a minute max, 5 minutes after that takeoff he's unconscious. The next thing he remembers, he's waking up and he's landed already. Maybe he thinks he didn't take off. He passed out and is in a completely different place.\nPEREIRA: How unusual is it, Dr. Dorian, for a person to survive subzero temperatures, lack of oxygen for 5-1\/2 hours and also that he didn't fall out of the landing gear.\nDORIAN: I kind of describe it as winning the lottery five times in a row. The fashion in which he did it, I would think it was a poor TV show production if they had a kid walk out of a wheel well like this. It's really mind-boggling.\nPEREIRA: The story he was telling us, he was trying to get home to Somalia to see his mother. You can imagine the heartbreak. You can imagine the concern the family has. Hopefully he'll get medical attention to deal with any issues that come up after this. Dr. Dorian, what a pleasure to talk to you. Some miracles stories we are talking about. Thanks for joining us from Los Angeles -- Chris.\nCUOMO: That just does not make sense. I don't know how that kid managed to not have any effects of such extreme conditions. Let's take a little break on NEW DAY to consider it. When we come back, an object of interest on the shoreline of Western Australia. Could it be debris from Flight 370?\nBOLDUAN: The death toll continues to rise in the South Korean ferry disaster. Why did so many victims fail to get out alive? We'll take you inside a simulator to get a better understanding of the life-or- death emergency at sea.",

He's going to probably remember the adrenaline rush of trying to hide inside that wheel well, the beginning of that takeoff, and then about a minute max, 5 minutes after that takeoff he's unconscious.

        "source":"MICHAELA PEREIRA, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back to NEW DAY. Medical professionals remain shocked that a 15-year-old boy can survive a 5- 1\/2 hour flight from California all the way to Hawaii in the wheel well of a Boeing 767. Although it is very rare, the teen would not be the first to live through this kind of journey. Back in 2000, a man survived a 7-1\/2-hour flight from Tahiti to Los Angeles in the wheel well of a plane. Joining me now is the very physician who successfully treated that stowaway, Dr. Armand Dorian. Dr. Dorian, what a pleasure to have you here. Why don't you describe to us the condition of the stowaway survivor that presented to you in the E.R. back in 2000?\nDR. ARMAND DORIAN, USC VERDUGO HILLS HOSPITAL: Back in 2000, the patient that rolled in by paramedics was not in the same state as this young boy this year. He was literally frozen, almost cartoonishly frozen. His arms were kind of jutted out. He was moaning. He was unconscious. He was not alert. We had to do multiple critical measures to keep him alive. His core body temperature was below 80 degrees. We had to intubate him, put chest tubes in. It was really touch and go.\nPEREIRA: It was really a miracle that he survived in your estimation?\nDORIAN: There's no question. I thought in my lifetime I would never even hear of another case like this, let alone hear of a case where the gentleman who was a stowaway walks away from the incident.\nPEREIRA: Let's get to that. You already compared the difference between that. Quickly, before we move on, do you know if that man had lasting side effects? Oftentimes you don't know the results many years later. Do you know?\nDORIAN: Actually he had no gross motor dysfunction, so something may actually be -- later on that may come up like depression, chronic headaches, but nothing obvious at the time when he was discharged from the hospital. Know that it was a month after he was admitted.\nPEREIRA: Interesting. OK, to this 15-year-old, he essentially after an hour after the plane landed sort of came out of the wheel well mostly able to move on his own power. This is phenomenal. Talk to me about what you think happened that this young man would present in a very different condition than the man in 2000.\nDORIAN: I mean, the planets all were aligned. This was a perfect storm of disaster that actually probably saved his life because when the airplane ascends, you lose oxygen, the air gets thin as we would say in layman's terms. You would pass out in about a minute after being up there. Also, the temperature drops. With the temperature dropping it actually starts slowing down your body's need for oxygen. It puts you in a frozen or some people termed it as a suspended state. Kind of like a cryogenic freezing that we've seen, you know, sci-fi or hear about in the future happening and because your demand decreases, you don't need as much oxygen. You can be suspended in time until your oxygen is replenished.\nPEREIRA: We know your patient passed out and doesn't remember a thing of his flight. We don't what this young boy remembers. We know that he did tell police that he was unconscious for a time.

        "source":"BERMAN: Tensions building in Scotland this morning and much of the United Kingdom as voters get ready for an historic vote on whether to split from the rest of the United Kingdom. Tomorrow's vote could see Scots declare independence, potentially splitting up Great Britain after 300 years. Now, some U.K. officials in Britain are pledging to give Scots new powers in an effort to sway a vote against independence. I want go to Max Foster right now who has the latest from Edinburgh. And, Max, these polls are so, so close.\nMAX FOSTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, three out today, John, and they're all too close to call. And you can really tell the story here from Edinburgh, by looking at the front pages of the newspapers. So, one of the polls on \"Scotsmen\" saying the polls has \"no\" in the land. But actually the \"yes\" campaign is closing the gap. And \"The Herald\", the only newspaper in Scotland supporting the \"yes\" campaign, is making the point that yes the pro-independent campaign is closing the gap and has the momentum and could overtake no by tomorrow. That's the suggestion, at least. Very clear on the front of \"The Daily Mail\", 24 hours to save Britain or to go independent. It really is a date with destiny tomorrow. We talked a bit about how there's a lot of attention to the run-up to tomorrow's poll. You know, this has been two years of campaigning and a lot of aggression, particularly on the yes side. And a very simple message here, keep the heat and carry on. That's the Scottish play on keep calm and carry campaigning, and to keep things calm really, because it is pretty tense here at the moment.\nBERMAN: Max, I think we have about a thousand questions here in the United States for you about this referendum. Can't possibly ask them all the time we have. But let me ask one that I think is surprising to many Americans. Scots want independence, they want to break away. But they want to keep the queen. They want to keep the monarchy. It seems as if they don't quite under this independence thing.\nFOSTER: I think this is a huge thing for the queen. I mean, she only came close to commenting. She can't get involved in politics. You know, she has to stay above politics. That's her constitutional rule. But she did say to a churchgoer recently she really hope that Scots consider this. You can imagine there was a very big British empire. Empires come and go. And the empire's really been cut back, of course. But now, you're talking about home turf, and her home state being split. I think she's pretty concerned about this. We have to say, in all essence, we're not talking about a big change in her role in Scotland, because the yes campaign they do want to keep her as head of state. But I certainly think that she's concerned about what's happening here. A breakup of the U.K., it's a huge moment in British history.\nBERMAN: It would be colossal, after more than 300 years, that vote is tomorrow. If they do vote to split, it would take 18 months to implement. Max Foster, great to have you here for us this morning. Thanks so much.\nROMANS: Big questions before the referendum of what a yes vote could mean for both economies. Harvard economist Ken Rogoff told me there are a lot of unknowns, the biggest being currency.\nKENNETH ROGOFF, PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS, HARVARD UNIVERSITY: When you got through with this divorce, suddenly you don't have the currency. What currency do you have? That's one of the first questions people will have, it's one of the first questions investors have. You really don't have an answer. They say it's the pound. The British say it's not the pound. People say, well, maybe Scotland will join the euro. That creates a lot of problems for the rest of the eurozone. And they could have their own currency, but that's not a magic elixir when you don't have long credibility.\nROMANS: It's a really big deal. Rogoff also said a yes vote could be -- maybe good for Scotland in the long run, he said like in a hundred years. But it's the short term uncertainly that is so concerning about this. He said, basically, it would be a mild negative for the U.K. and very big -- very big negative for Scotland. He also said, look, when Americans say why does this matter to me? I've heard this, why do I care? He says, because the U.K. and U.S. have the strongest alliance in the world. And this is our best friend breaking apart. It's a very big deal.\nBERMAN: It has huge implications for international relations as well.

Tomorrow's vote could see Scots declare independence, potentially splitting up Great Britain after 300 years. Now, some U.K. officials in Britain are pledging to give Scots new powers in an effort to sway a vote against independence. I want go to Max Foster right now who has the latest from Edinburgh. And, Max, these polls are so, so close.\nMAX FOSTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, three out today, John, and they're all too close to call. And you can really tell the story here from Edinburgh, by looking at the front pages of the newspapers. So, one of the polls on \"Scotsmen\" saying the polls has \"no\" in the land. But actually the \"yes\" campaign is closing the gap. And \"The Herald\", the only newspaper in Scotland supporting the \"yes\" campaign, is making the point that yes the pro-independent campaign is closing the gap and has the momentum and could overtake no by tomorrow. That's the suggestion, at least. Very clear on the front of \"The Daily Mail\", 24 hours to save Britain or to go independent. It really is a date with destiny tomorrow. We talked a bit about how there's a lot of attention to the run-up to tomorrow's poll. You know, this has been two years of campaigning and a lot of aggression, particularly on the yes side. And a very simple message here, keep the heat and carry on. That's the Scottish play on keep calm and carry campaigning, and to keep things calm really, because it is pretty tense here at the moment.\nBERMAN: Max, I think we have about a thousand questions here in the United States for you about this referendum. Can't possibly ask them all the time we have. But let me ask one that I think is surprising to many Americans. Scots want independence, they want to break away. But they want to keep the queen. They want to keep the monarchy. It seems as if they don't quite under this independence thing.\nFOSTER: I think this is a huge thing for the queen. I mean, she only came close to commenting. She can't get involved in politics. You know, she has to stay above politics. That's her constitutional rule. But she did say to a churchgoer recently she really hope that Scots consider this. You can imagine there was a very big British empire. Empires come and go. And the empire's really been cut back, of course. But now, you're talking about home turf, and her home state being split. I think she's pretty concerned about this. We have to say, in all essence, we're not talking about a big change in her role in Scotland, because the yes campaign they do want to keep her as head of state. But I certainly think that she's concerned about what's happening here. A breakup of the U.K., it's a huge moment in British history.\nBERMAN: It would be colossal, after more than 300 years, that vote is tomorrow. If they do vote to split, it would take 18 months to implement. Max Foster, great to have you here for us this morning. Thanks so much.\nROMANS: Big questions before the referendum of what a yes vote could mean for both economies. Harvard economist Ken Rogoff told me there are a lot of unknowns, the biggest being currency.\nKENNETH ROGOFF, PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS, HARVARD UNIVERSITY: When you got through with this divorce, suddenly you don't have the currency. What currency do you have? That's one of the first questions people will have, it's one of the first questions investors have. You really don't have an answer. They say it's the pound. The British say it's not the pound. People say, well, maybe Scotland will join the euro. That creates a lot of problems for the rest of the eurozone. And they could have their own currency, but that's not a magic elixir when you don't have long credibility.\nROMANS: It's a really big deal. Rogoff also said a yes vote could be -- maybe good for Scotland in the long run, he said like in a hundred years. But it's the short term uncertainly that is so concerning about this. He said, basically, it would be a mild negative for the U.K. and very big -- very big negative for Scotland. He also said, look, when Americans say why does this matter to me? I've heard this, why do I care? He says, because the U.K. and U.S. have the strongest alliance in the world. And this is our best friend breaking apart. It's a very big deal.\nBERMAN: It has huge implications for international relations as well.

That's the suggestion, at least. Very clear on the front of \"The Daily Mail\", 24 hours to save Britain or to go independent. It really is a date with destiny tomorrow. We talked a bit about how there's a lot of attention to the run-up to tomorrow's poll. You know, this has been two years of campaigning and a lot of aggression, particularly on the yes side. And a very simple message here, keep the heat and carry on. That's the Scottish play on keep calm and carry campaigning, and to keep things calm really, because it is pretty tense here at the moment.\nBERMAN: Max, I think we have about a thousand questions here in the United States for you about this referendum. Can't possibly ask them all the time we have. But let me ask one that I think is surprising to many Americans. Scots want independence, they want to break away. But they want to keep the queen. They want to keep the monarchy. It seems as if they don't quite under this independence thing.\nFOSTER: I think this is a huge thing for the queen. I mean, she only came close to commenting. She can't get involved in politics. You know, she has to stay above politics. That's her constitutional rule. But she did say to a churchgoer recently she really hope that Scots consider this. You can imagine there was a very big British empire. Empires come and go. And the empire's really been cut back, of course. But now, you're talking about home turf, and her home state being split. I think she's pretty concerned about this. We have to say, in all essence, we're not talking about a big change in her role in Scotland, because the yes campaign they do want to keep her as head of state. But I certainly think that she's concerned about what's happening here. A breakup of the U.K., it's a huge moment in British history.\nBERMAN: It would be colossal, after more than 300 years, that vote is tomorrow. If they do vote to split, it would take 18 months to implement. Max Foster, great to have you here for us this morning. Thanks so much.\nROMANS: Big questions before the referendum of what a yes vote could mean for both economies. Harvard economist Ken Rogoff told me there are a lot of unknowns, the biggest being currency.\nKENNETH ROGOFF, PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS, HARVARD UNIVERSITY: When you got through with this divorce, suddenly you don't have the currency. What currency do you have? That's one of the first questions people will have, it's one of the first questions investors have. You really don't have an answer. They say it's the pound. The British say it's not the pound. People say, well, maybe Scotland will join the euro. That creates a lot of problems for the rest of the eurozone. And they could have their own currency, but that's not a magic elixir when you don't have long credibility.\nROMANS: It's a really big deal. Rogoff also said a yes vote could be -- maybe good for Scotland in the long run, he said like in a hundred years. But it's the short term uncertainly that is so concerning about this. He said, basically, it would be a mild negative for the U.K. and very big -- very big negative for Scotland. He also said, look, when Americans say why does this matter to me? I've heard this, why do I care? He says, because the U.K. and U.S. have the strongest alliance in the world. And this is our best friend breaking apart. It's a very big deal.\nBERMAN: It has huge implications for international relations as well. Again, what do you do to every other separatist movement in the world?\nROMANS: To say nothing of America's nuclear position in northern Europe, it's in Scotland.\nBERMAN: Fascinating. It will all be decided tomorrow. Twenty-seven minutes after the hour. Could U.S. troops end up fighting on the ground against ISIS?

What currency do you have? That's one of the first questions people will have, it's one of the first questions investors have. You really don't have an answer. They say it's the pound. The British say it's not the pound. People say, well, maybe Scotland will join the euro. That creates a lot of problems for the rest of the eurozone. And they could have their own currency, but that's not a magic elixir when you don't have long credibility.\nROMANS: It's a really big deal. Rogoff also said a yes vote could be -- maybe good for Scotland in the long run, he said like in a hundred years. But it's the short term uncertainly that is so concerning about this. He said, basically, it would be a mild negative for the U.K. and very big -- very big negative for Scotland. He also said, look, when Americans say why does this matter to me? I've heard this, why do I care? He says, because the U.K. and U.S. have the strongest alliance in the world. And this is our best friend breaking apart. It's a very big deal.\nBERMAN: It has huge implications for international relations as well. Again, what do you do to every other separatist movement in the world?\nROMANS: To say nothing of America's nuclear position in northern Europe, it's in Scotland.\nBERMAN: Fascinating. It will all be decided tomorrow. Twenty-seven minutes after the hour. Could U.S. troops end up fighting on the ground against ISIS?

        "source":"BERMAN: Tensions building in Scotland this morning and much of the United Kingdom as voters get ready for an historic vote on whether to split from the rest of the United Kingdom. Tomorrow's vote could see Scots declare independence, potentially splitting up Great Britain after 300 years. Now, some U.K. officials in Britain are pledging to give Scots new powers in an effort to sway a vote against independence. I want go to Max Foster right now who has the latest from Edinburgh. And, Max, these polls are so, so close.\nMAX FOSTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, three out today, John, and they're all too close to call. And you can really tell the story here from Edinburgh, by looking at the front pages of the newspapers. So, one of the polls on \"Scotsmen\" saying the polls has \"no\" in the land. But actually the \"yes\" campaign is closing the gap. And \"The Herald\", the only newspaper in Scotland supporting the \"yes\" campaign, is making the point that yes the pro-independent campaign is closing the gap and has the momentum and could overtake no by tomorrow. That's the suggestion, at least. Very clear on the front of \"The Daily Mail\", 24 hours to save Britain or to go independent. It really is a date with destiny tomorrow. We talked a bit about how there's a lot of attention to the run-up to tomorrow's poll. You know, this has been two years of campaigning and a lot of aggression, particularly on the yes side. And a very simple message here, keep the heat and carry on. That's the Scottish play on keep calm and carry campaigning, and to keep things calm really, because it is pretty tense here at the moment.\nBERMAN: Max, I think we have about a thousand questions here in the United States for you about this referendum. Can't possibly ask them all the time we have. But let me ask one that I think is surprising to many Americans. Scots want independence, they want to break away. But they want to keep the queen. They want to keep the monarchy. It seems as if they don't quite under this independence thing.\nFOSTER: I think this is a huge thing for the queen. I mean, she only came close to commenting. She can't get involved in politics. You know, she has to stay above politics. That's her constitutional rule. But she did say to a churchgoer recently she really hope that Scots consider this. You can imagine there was a very big British empire. Empires come and go. And the empire's really been cut back, of course. But now, you're talking about home turf, and her home state being split. I think she's pretty concerned about this. We have to say, in all essence, we're not talking about a big change in her role in Scotland, because the yes campaign they do want to keep her as head of state. But I certainly think that she's concerned about what's happening here. A breakup of the U.K., it's a huge moment in British history.\nBERMAN: It would be colossal, after more than 300 years, that vote is tomorrow. If they do vote to split, it would take 18 months to implement. Max Foster, great to have you here for us this morning.
